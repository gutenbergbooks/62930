</div>

<p class='c006'>At the beginning of the sixth inning, Sam Kates
went into the box against the Tufts freshmen. The
score then stood seven to one, in favor of Yale Umpty-ten.
Tufts had shown no ability to connect with Dick
Merriwell’s shoots and benders. This was the opportunity
to give Sam a good try-out, and so, at Dick’s
suggestion, he changed places with Kates, who had
been playing first.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the opening of the game, Tufts had professed a
hilarious confidence in its ability to hit Merriwell, but
within a short time this confidence oozed away, and
the game was proving tiresomely one-sided and monotonous
when Yale changed pitchers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately Tufts braced up and took heart. Kates
was nervous, and the visitors seemed to know it. They
whooped and barked joyously as the first man to face
Sam lined out a sizzling two-bagger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind that, Kates,” came reassuringly from
Dick. “Those things will happen occasionally. They
can’t all do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless Kates realized that he was trying to
fill the position just vacated by one vastly his superior,
and he also knew the Yale men who had been cheering
lustily in the stand were aware of the same fact. This
placed him at a disadvantage, for he was extremely
anxious, and a pitcher who gets anxious in the box is
almost sure to be an easy mark for the opposing batters.
Kates, under the manly influence of Dick Merriwell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>had broken away from former undesirable associations
and was now putting forth his best efforts to
redeem his past mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following Tufts man pounded a long fly into
the outfield. The ball was caught, but the runner on
second advanced to third after the catch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right,” again assured Dick. “They haven’t
scored, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But, unfortunately, the team had even less confidence
in Kates than he had in himself. Therefore,
they were likewise anxious, and this anxiety caused
Claxton, at second, to let a warm grounder get through
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little band of Tufts rooters yelled wildly as
another tally was chalked down for their side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep after him! keep after him!” whooped a
coacher, as the next batter pranced out to the pan.
“Got him going!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll put the blanket on him in a minute,” came
from the other coacher. “Knock his eye out, Tompkins!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tompkins responded by slamming a hot one into
right field, where Bouncer Bigelow fell all over himself,
and lost the ball until another run had been
credited to the visitors and Tompkins had third safely
within his clutch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not your fault, Kates,” said Dick, as the wretched
pitcher cast him an appealing glance. “Nobody can
blame you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Blessed Jones, captain of the team, rushed part way
in from left field and called to his players to steady
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the bench Robinson, the manager, was fidgeting
ponderously, and muttering to himself that Merriwell
would have to go back on the slab.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick walked out into the diamond, and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>thought that he was going to change places with Kates
once more. Instead of doing so, he placed a hand on
Sam’s shoulder and spoke to him in low tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t get worried now because of those errors behind
you. They’ve made one clean hit off you, and
that’s all. This sort of a thing is likely to happen to
any one. It might have happened to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t believe it,” muttered Kates. “They
won’t back me up, Merriwell, old man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ll learn to back you up before the season’s
over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I throw away the first game in which I’m
given a chance to pitch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re not throwing it away. Don’t look
round, Kates. That fellow on third is going to try
to steal home. He thinks neither of us sees him. He’s
edging off. Now—nail him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates whirled like a flash, and found the runner well
off third, balanced on his toes, and ready to make a
sprint for the plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a snap Sam sent the ball to Otis Fitch, who
had covered the sack behind the runner’s back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nipped just in time, the Tufts man tried to plunge
headlong back to third, but Fitch clutched the ball and
nailed it onto him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re out!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p class='c007'>This piece of work caused the Yale men to cheer,
while the Tufts lad who had been caught in his own
attempt to work a bit of craft walked in to the bench
shaking his hanging head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rotten! rotten!” snapped one of the coachers.
“Why don’t you keep your eyes open? Why don’t
you do your sleeping nights? You can’t afford to
get dopy on bases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But everybody hits! everybody hits!” came from
the coacher at the other side of the field. “We’ll keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>right on. We’ll pound him off the rubber just the
same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But, somehow, Sam’s nervousness had disappeared
beneath the effect of Merriwell’s touch and words.
Having caught the runner in this manner, Kates grew
cool and collected, and the next man up promptly bit
at two twisters that he did not touch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you’re pitching, old fellow,” laughed Dick.
“The poor boy can’t see the ball. He’s yours, Sam—he’s
yours. Eat him up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates had a huge drop, and this was the next ball he
used. As he delivered it, however, he pretended it had
slipped from his fingers, and he yelled for Buckhart
to “look out.” The batter thought the ball too high,
and made no move to swing. The sphere shot down in
an astonishing manner and crossed the batter’s chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Three strikes—out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deceived hitter stood as if dazed for a moment,
and then savagely hurled his bat to the ground. Once
more the Yale stand cheered, and Merriwell walked in
to the bench with Kates, congratulating him with sincere
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got to do your best work to-day, Sam,”
said Dick. “You’ve got to prove yourself. I need
you. Toleman won’t come out. He’s still sulking. I
can’t do all the pitching. The games are coming too
thick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t wholly my fault, was it, Merriwell?”
asked Kates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not. Still, you’d better not kick about
your support, for that gets the fellows sore. They
know what they did, and they feel as rotten about it
as any one can. You’ll hold Tufts down after this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if you see they’re going to win the game, Dick,
you must go onto the slab again. You’ll do this, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“If you don’t get the idea into your head that it’s
necessary, I believe I won’t have to pitch another ball
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if it is necessary——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I won’t see them win the game if I can help
it, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Tufts pitcher, who had improved as the game
advanced, now seemed to be at his best, and Yale
could do little with his delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not until the first of the eighth did anything more
of a sensational nature occur. In the eighth Tufts
got a batter to first by an error, and then Kates had
the misfortune to hit the next man. The third batter
lifted a long fly into center field, where Spratt made
a disgraceful muff and lost sight of the ball. While
Jack was spluttering to himself and pawing around
wildly in the grass, all three of the Tufts men romped
over the sacks and raced across the pan.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was now great excitement, for Tufts needed
only one more run to tie the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates gave Dick a questioning look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No fault of yours,” came once more from Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they won’t support me, they won’t support
me!” muttered Sam, in a disheartened manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The uproar was so great that Dick could not hear
these words, although he read them plainly by the
movement of Sam’s lips. Again he trotted out into
the diamond, and once more the spectators fancied it
was his intention to resume pitching.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you quit, Kates,” was what he said. “If you
do, they’ll never give you any backing. Pitch as if
your life depended on it, but keep cool—keep cool and
use your head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an audible groan as Dick was seen returning
to first.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The next Tufts man batted a slow grounder at
Tucker, who juggled the ball a moment and then made
a disgustingly bad throw to first. Dick was forced to
leave the sack and leap into the air to get the ball, and
the hitter crossed the hassock in safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>With no one out, Tufts’ prospects of tying the score
were bright indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out for a bunt, Sam,” warned Dick, who believed
the visitors would try to sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infielders crept in toward the plate, and poised
themselves on their toes, every muscle taut.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intention of the enemy had not been miscalculated.
The bunt came, and the runner on first reached
second while Kates got the ball and “killed” the batter
at first.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now a fine single properly placed would be almost
sure to give the enemy the coveted run to make
the score a tie.</p>

<p class='c007'>More than that, the next hitter was one of the cleverest
batsmen on the visiting team. Kates used all his
art and skill on the man, but finally the fellow smashed
the ball, driving it on a line toward right field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick was playing ten or twelve feet into the diamond.
He made an electrified leap, shot out his right
hand, and pulled the liner down. The moment his feet
touched the ground he was ready to throw to second,
but he made sure that Claxton would get the ball. The
runner on second had started for third, but he stopped
and nearly broke himself in two in an effort to get
back.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a second too late, and the double play put
something of a dampener on Tufts’ elation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates heaved a great sigh of relief, and something
like a sickly smile of joy passed over his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was what he needed to put him once more at
his best, for he struck out the man who followed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 id='II' class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>A HEART-BREAKING FINISH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But Kates’ troubles were not over. Yale did nothing
with the Tufts twirler in the eighth, and Tufts
opened the ninth with another two-sack bingle that
made the Yale crowd feel sick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one yelled for Merriwell. Kates again cast a
questioning glance toward Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we pull him out,” Dick thought, “he’ll have no
further backbone for pitching.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones started in from the field. Divining the intention
of Blessed, Dick hurriedly waved him back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buckhart looked disgusted, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Reckon my pard wants to throw this game away,”
he muttered to himself. “We’ll lose it if we let Kates
stay on the rubber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Kates stayed. Aware that Dick still had confidence
in him, Sam forced the following Tufts man
to put up an easy infield fly, which was captured by
Tucker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All we want is a clean hit, Stroud!” cried a Tufts
coacher. “You’re the boy to do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stroud was a dangerous man with the stick, and
the spectators hung poised on a point of painful suspense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four times Stroud fouled. Then Sam twisted one
round his neck, and he missed cleanly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the way! that’s the way!” laughed Dick.
“Now it’s all right! That lively lad will pass away
on second.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With two strikes and only one ball called by the
umpire, it began to seem as if Kates would mow down
the last Tufts batter. But the fellow picked out a
corner-cutter and raised it far into left field.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“All over!” shouted some one. “Jonesy has it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonesy thought he had it, but as the ball settled it
took one of those exasperating curves which are troublesome
to handle, and Blessed merely touched it with
the fingers of one upthrust hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the dismayed Yale captain could get the
ball back into the diamond the score was tied, and
Tufts had another runner on third.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got this game—we’ve got it!” barked a
coacher. “They’ll never get away from us now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everybody knew what would happen,” cried a
voice. “The game was lost when they changed pitchers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Strangely enough, Kates was no longer downcast
and lacking in confidence. He told himself that any
person with good baseball judgment must know he was
not responsible for what had happened. He did not
cast any further questioning looks toward first, but
placed himself on the rubber, ready to pitch at his best
as long as they would let him remain there.</p>

<p class='c007'>His best proved good enough to fan the next Tufts
man, and Yale came to bat in the last of the ninth with
the tally tied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll do ’em up in the next inning,” announced the
Tufts captain, who seemed confident that there would
be an extra inning.</p>

<p class='c007'>It quickly began to look as if there would be such
an inning, for the first two Yale batters went out, one
on a fly and the other on an easy grounder into the
diamond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came a bad error for Tufts. Spratt, who
batted ahead of Kates, bumped a bounder toward third,
and reached first on an infielder’s fumble.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant Kates seemed benumbed as he realized
he was the next person to hit. A strange silence
had settled over the field, and Sam fancied he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>feel the eyes of every spectator fixed upon him as he
stepped out, bat in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>As if from a great distance he seemed to hear some
one say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps he’ll win his own game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he only could!” said another; but there was only
doubt in the words and the voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates glanced toward Spratt, and a signal told him
that the desperate fellow on first would try to steal.
To assist Jack, Sam swung wildly at the first ball
pitched, although he was careful not to hit it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spratt’s thin legs carried him down the line to second
with deceptive speed, and a beautiful slide landed
him safely on the sack a second before he was tagged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Safe!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spratt leaped up, dusting his clothes and grinning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re dud-dud-dreadfully slow,” he observed
mockingly to the second baseman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, never mind,” was the retort. “You won’t go
any farther.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Th-think so?” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Know so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bub-bub-bet you on it. Kates is gug-going to
biff it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam heard those words. Here, at least, seemed to
be one person besides Merriwell who had confidence
in him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will biff it!” he decided.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made good in a way that brought the Yale men
up standing. Bat and ball cracked together, and the
ball was laced into the field halfway between right
and center.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker, on the coaching line near third, waved his
arms frantically and shrieked until he was purple in
the face as Spratt came straddling on. Jack’s teeth
were gleaming, his hands clenched, and his eyes bulging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>out of his head. As he crossed third the breath
whistled from his nostrils with a sound that reminded
one of a racehorse coming under the wire.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fielder had the ball. He whipped it to the second
baseman. The second baseman turned and lined it to
the catcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slide!” shrieked Tucker and many others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spratt flung himself headlong, as if making a dive.
Along the ground he scooted in a manner that seemed
to proclaim the dry soil greased at that particular point.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plunk!—the ball landed in the catcher’s mitt. Down
he ducked and planted it between Spratt’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Jack had both hands on the plate, and the umpire
yelled: “Safe!”</p>

<p class='c007'>To Dick Merriwell’s unspeakable satisfaction, Sam
Kates had really won his own game.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 id='III' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>A SURPRISE FOR DICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the dressing room there was a jabber of youthful
voices as the players got into their street clothes.
Kates was feeling pretty well, for the fellows who
had made errors behind him, one and all, had come
forward and offered congratulations over his work,
at the same time blaming themselves for repeatedly
putting him into a bad hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Casper Steele, in a motoring suit, appeared and expressed
his appreciation of the hair-lifting game he had
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was really losing interest when you went out of
the box, Merriwell, old man!” laughed Casper. “That
finish was a heart-breaker, though. How long before
you and your friends will be ready to start for Meadwold?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On my word,” said Dick, “I’d forgotten about your
invitation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you can go?” questioned Steele anxiously.
“You said you’d let me know if you couldn’t get away,
and I haven’t heard a word from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right, I can go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about Claxton and Buckhart?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They will come along. It’s all fixed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! A day off to-morrow will be to the benefit
of all of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about Tucker?” asked Dick, in a low tone.
“I don’t like to go away and leave him to himself for
even a day. I’ve taken the liberty of asking him if
he’ll join us, providing you don’t object.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, look here, old man,” said Steele, “didn’t I
tell you this was to be your party? Didn’t I tell you
to invite any one you wished?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I meant it. It’s to be a little housewarming, you
know. The gov’nor will have a party of his own down
there next week. Just now he has some sort of a
business deal on that is keeping him mighty busy. I
have my car here, and I’ll take you and your chosen
friends to pick up your dunnage. It’s forty miles to
Meadwold, and it will be dark before we get there,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was mighty fine of you to plan this little outing,
Steele,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I hope you and your friends enjoy yourselves,
and I think you will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meadwold was the name given to a large country
estate purchased the previous year by Peyton Steele,
Casper’s father. Steele was a man who loved the
country and country life, and it was his intention to
make this newly acquired property an ideal summer
home for his occupancy. The old farm buildings had
been renovated and enlarged. Broad verandas had
been built. A fine stable was put up, and the place
was stocked with blooded horses and choice cattle. A
complete corps of servants had been installed at Meadwold,
and everything was ready for the housewarming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blessed Jones had been invited to become one of the
party, but had solemnly expressed it as his duty to
remain in town and look after those ball players who
needed watching. He now came up, with a sad and
doleful expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Methinks thou wilt have a high old time, brothers,”
he said. “But look here, Steele, you want to remember
that these fellows are under training-table regulations.
Don’t gorge them with ice cream and cake and such
disastrous delicacies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave that to me,” said Dick. “We’ll behave,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Jones. Don’t be afraid. Too bad you don’t feel that
you ought to come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is too bad,” nodded Steele. “I’d enjoy having
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without doubt,” said Blessed. “I would add immensely
to the gayety of the aggregation. I’m generally
about as funny as a funeral.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker was pleased when he learned beyond doubt
that he was to be one of the party. Steele took them
in his car, and soon they were at the curb in front of
the lodging house on York Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll get my things and come back here,” said Rob
Claxton, as he sprang from the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirty minutes later the big touring car was bearing
them out of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’ll certainly be fine to get out into the country,
where we can gambol with the little lambkins,” laughed
Tucker. “I need it. My! but wasn’t that a lovely
throw I made to you, Dick? I had a spasm when I
realized what I’d done. Didn’t think you’d ever touch
it, but you raked her in with one paw. Say, how long
is your arm? I swear you reached eleven feet into the
air for that ball!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please don’t talk about errors, suh,” entreated
Claxton. “I’d like to forget that awful mess I made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kates sure pitched a good game,” observed Buckhart.
“But there was one time I thought he had gone
to the bowwows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That game reminds me of the last one I played in
before coming to college,” said Tucker. “The finish
was just about as sensational. We had the other fellows
going up to the seventh inning, when they got
after our pitcher and bumped him. In the ninth inning
they needed one run to tie, and two to win, and
they had the bases filled. It was their last turn to
bat, and two men were out. I was playing center
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>field. Up came the heaviest batter on their team, and
he slammed a long fly out into my garden. The
ground out there was awfully soft in spots, and when
I started for that fly one of my feet got stuck in a
hole so that I couldn’t pull it out to save my neck.
There was the ball coming down just about six feet
beyond my reach, and me held fast by one hoof. I tell
you it was awful. Perspiration literally started out on
my face in drops as big as gooseberries. But I got the
ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you do it, suh?” asked Claxton curiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you see, I just stooped down, cut my shoe
laces, pulled my foot out of my shoe, made a lunge,
and grabbed the ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remarkable!” breathed Rob. “Cut your shoe
laces, did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you usually carry a knife around in your baseball
suit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no,” confessed Tommy, looking a bit confused.
“I didn’t cut my laces with a knife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you cut them with, if you don’t mind
telling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With a blade of grass, of course,” snorted Tucker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell, Buckhart, and Steele laughed, and, after
a moment, Claxton joined in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’ll about do for you, Tommy,” said Dick.
“Don’t tell us any more such wonderful yarns. We
can’t quite digest them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>New Haven was now left behind, and the car was
humming smoothly over the road. The boys had
brought along their heavy coats, and, therefore, were
quite comfortable, although it was growing cool as
the sun sank in the west. A beautiful sunset filled
them all with admiration and delight. The ride in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>big, easy car was calculated to soothe their overstrained
nerves after the excitement of the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strange,” said Claxton, “I didn’t see Miss Ditson
or Miss Midhurst at the game. They usually attend.
Were they there, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t see them myself,” confessed Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” said Buckhart. “I reckon they were not
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one observed the faint smile that flitted across
the face of Casper Steele as he bent over the steering
wheel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fancy you’re right,” he said. “I looked around
at the crowd in the stand, and I saw nothing of those
girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun had vanished, and purple shadows were
spreading in the east. They stopped to light the lamps,
and then bowled on again. Night enfolded them
softly, and the bright glare of the lamps grew more and
more effective as the darkness increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re getting near Meadwold,” Steele finally announced.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few moments later they swung in at a gate with
high stone posts, and followed a private road that
wound between long lines of gnarled old trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll see the lights in a minute,” said Casper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surmounting a little rise, they beheld before them
the gleam of many lights, and Steele told them that
was Meadwold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee whiz!” piped Tucker. “They’ve certainly illuminated
gorgeously for our arrival.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a party of friends there who are expecting
us,” was Casper’s surprising announcement.</p>

<p class='c007'>He now pressed the pedal, and the Gabriel horn
sang sweetly through the spring night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will tell them we’re coming,” he laughed.
“They’ll be on the veranda to welcome us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>And now the boys discovered that the veranda and
the trees in the immediate vicinity of the house were
hung with hundreds of Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they swung up the fine road to the front of the
house they heard a chorus of youthful voices, and
forth from the wide front door came swarming a
merry band of boys and girls. There were fully thirty
of them, and they crowded to the steps, waving their
handkerchiefs and laughingly crying welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great horn spoon!” muttered Brad Buckhart.
“What are we up against?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dick was speechless, for there, in the mellow
light of the many lanterns, standing in front of all the
others, her hands outstretched to him, was the one girl
he knew best in all the world—June Arlington!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>A HEARTY WELCOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Welcome, welcome to Meadwold!” cried the merry
voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick’s eyes swam in a happy, wondering mist. At
that moment he feared it was all a dream from which
he would quickly awaken. This vision of June—June,
radiant and flushed, and more beautiful than ever—could
not be other than a dream.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dick—Dick, don’t you know me? Dick, aren’t you
glad to see me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was her voice. He would have known it had it
reached his ears in the heart of darkest Africa. This
was no dream; it was a grand, joyous reality. The
next instant he was on the steps, both her warm hands
clasped in his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“June, June!” he murmured ecstatically. “June, is
it possible? Can it be I’m really awake and this is
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kiss her! kiss her! kiss her!” shouted a chorus of
voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>June, red as a fresh-blown peony, her voice trembling
with excitement, her eyes gleaming like twin
stars, answered his questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it is I, and, of course, you’re wide
awake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, he isn’t,” piped another voice, that sounded
strangely familiar. “If he was wide awake, he would
never pass up an opportunity like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is it possible that I find you here?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chester will explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chester——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Present,” laughed a bronzed youth, stepping
quickly down and placing an affectionate hand on
Dick’s shoulder. “How are you, Merriwell, old man?
On my soul, I’m quivering with delight over seeing
you again. Give us a grip at that man’s hand of
yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was June’s brother, who wrung Dick’s hand
with all the hearty regard and affection of his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My head is humming,” laughed the bewildered boy.
“I thought you were in Wellsburg, June; and you,
Chester—I thought you somewhere away out in the
wild and woolly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve shed my chaps, had my hair cut, hung up the
riata, and come back to civilization,” said Arlington.
“But I don’t suppose we ought to monopolize him,
June. He has other friends who are anxious to get
at him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While June and Chet turned to Brad Buckhart, Dick
shook hands with Jack Randall, of Harvard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite a lively little party this of yours,” smiled
the handsome Harvard man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mine?” said Dick. “Why, Steele got up this
party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we all understand it’s for your benefit and entertainment.
Here are Barbara and Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And now Dick understood why he had not seen Bab
Midhurst and Mabel Ditson at the baseball game that
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a conspiracy!” he cried. “I have been deceived,
and I’m glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I brought another friend of yours along with me,”
said Randall. “Where is he? He should have been
among the first to attack you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like the modest, shrinking little violet that I am,”
said the voice that had declared Dick was not wide
awake when he shook hands with June, “I am content
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to bloom low amid the other gorgeous flowers of this
fair garden. Therefore, I am easily overlooked.
Hello, Dick! Give us the high wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dale Sparkfair, you handsome rascal!” cried Merriwell,
getting a good hold on the speaker’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sparkfair it was, jolly, jovial, scintillating as ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, I’m always loth to thrust myself forward,
Dick,” said Spark. “I’ve been suppressed and
sat on so much since butting into Harvard that my
natural timidness and reticence has increased a thousandfold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppressed? Sat on?” laughed Randall. “If ever
there was a freshman who could not be suppressed and
sat on, this fresh freshman is the one. Why, he’s had
all Cambridge standing on its head the biggest part of
the time since he landed there. A dozen times he’s
turned the old place over to look at the bottom side
of it. He has more friends and enemies to the square
yard than any man at Harvard who is not a senior or
a big gun in athletics.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fie! fie!” remonstrated Dale. “I fear much that
you will give people a false impression by the careless
trippling of your tongue. Trippling is good. I think
I’ll copyright it. I’m great at coining words. That’s
about the only kind of coin I can get hold of lately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Introductions followed, Dick presenting his Yale
friends to those friends of his he had unexpectedly
found at Meadwold. All were then made acquainted
with the young people, youths, and maids who belonged
to Casper Steele’s particular set. At the very beginning
of these introductions, in a cautious whisper,
Sparkfair warned Dick not to exhaust his supply of
“hot-air compliments” too quickly, as there were lots
of pretty girls in the party, and he would need a liberal
supply to go round.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steele had turned the touring car over to his mechanician,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>who was awaiting the arrival at Meadwold.
He now led the way into the renovated house, and the
chattering guests flocked after him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Casper’s mother was there, standing just inside the
door and smiling on them all. She gave her hand to
Dick and his friends as her son presented her. There
were also two other middle-aged ladies who were present
as chaperons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m very glad to meet Dick Merriwell,” said Mrs.
Steele. “You won’t mind if I call you Dick, will you?
You see, I’ve heard Casper call you that so often that
it’s most natural for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am genuinely complimented to know that you
wish to call me by my Christian name, Mrs. Steele,” he
bowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must make yourself at home—you and your
friends. I hope you all have a pleasant time at Meadwold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is assured already, madam. I’ve had one of
the most delightful surprises of my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Steele took Dick, Brad, Rob, and Tommy upstairs
to the room they were to occupy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, we’re a bit crowded,” he explained.
“There are two beds here and a bath adjoining. I
think you’ll be comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Comfortable!” said the Texan, looking around.
“Great horn spoon, I should say so! Why, this is
great for a man who has found comfort sleeping in
a blanket, with his boots for his pillow and the ground
for his bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m certainly glad I came,” said Tucker.
“Isn’t it great, boys?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It reminds me of hospitality in old Virginia, gentlemen,”
came from Claxton. “I didn’t suppose they had
anything like it in your cold and reserved North.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we’re not as cold and reserved as we seem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>once you get under our skins,” chuckled Steele. “Take
your time to wash up, fellows. Come down when you
get ready. I fancy we’ll have dinner very soon now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great chap, that Steele,” murmured Tommy, as
the door closed behind Casper. “And to think he
didn’t get through college—it’s a shame. But then, he
has so much money that he doesn’t need a college education
to help him spend it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that’s one of the brightest remarks I ever
heard you make, Tucker,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen!” exclaimed Buckhart. “I sure hear music!
On my word, they’ve got an orchestra.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true, for the soft strains of an orchestra
floated up to their ears from some part of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Steele is certainly doing the thing up brown,”
chuckled Tucker. “Go ahead, Dick, and make your
ablutions. You’re the one in this bunch who’s most
wanted down below. The rest of us won’t be missed
if we’re slower in reappearing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick pulled off his coat, rolled back his cuffs, and
disappeared into the bathroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No flies on this party, eh?” grinned Tucker.
“Everybody agreeable and congenial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buckhart shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With one exception, possibly,” he muttered, not
wishing Dick to hear. “Chester Arlington might have
improved the party had he remained away. He was
Dick’s bitterest enemy at Fardale, and I can’t easily
forget the dirty tricks in which he was concerned. My
pard seems to think the fellow has reformed, but I’m
far from satisfied on that point. I doubt if any one
as rotten as Arlington has been ever wholly reformed.
However, I’m willing to give him the benefit of the
doubt until he shows the cloven hoof again. If he
does that, I’ll certain feel like lighting on him all
spraddled out. You hear me softly warble!”</p>

  <h2 id='V' class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE DINNER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The dinner was a grand success. Two long tables
had been placed end to end, and around these tables
gathered the light-hearted guests, skillfully seated in
such a way that each youth found a congenial and
charming girl at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, June was at Dick’s side. For the time
being, Mrs. Steele and the two elderly ladies had
withdrawn, and there was no one present to cast the
lightest restraint on the innocent mirth of the gathering.
Waiters were numerous, silent, and attentive, and
the courses came on in a manner that would have done
credit to a first-class hotel. Somewhere in a near-by
room the orchestra discoursed appropriate music. Beneath
the softened lights the china, cutglass, and silverware
gleamed, and the girls, flushed with pleasurable
excitement, seemed the fairest to be found in all the
land.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, I’m ready to explode with curiosity,
June,” said Dick, under cover of the chatter that rose
about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you are,” she laughed tantalizingly, giving
him a look with those splendid eyes of hers that
shot him through with the old-time thrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you don’t seem in any hurry to satisfy that
curiosity. Don’t tantalize me, June. How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your brother brought my brother back with him
to Wellsburg when he returned from the West.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know; but Wellsburg is a long distance from
Meadwold. It’s mysterious. I didn’t suppose Casper
Steele knew you, yet I find you here at his father’s
country home.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“My father knows Mr. Payton Steele very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see a faint ray.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have often had business relations. At present
father is carrying through a business deal in company
with Mr. Steele. To do this he had to come on
here, and, when he found he was coming, both Chester
and myself begged him to bring us along. That’s the
explanation, Dick. We met Casper Steele, and as soon
as he found out we were your friends he began to
plan this surprise party for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I never suspected a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the head of the table Steele laughed at Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was afraid you might get a suspicion of it,” he
said, having caught Merriwell’s words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to get even with
you, old chap,” said Dick. “But perhaps I’ll find a
way some time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Near the foot of the long table sat Mabel Ditson,
with Brad Buckhart on her right and Rob Claxton on
her left. She was dividing her favors between them,
and both seemed satisfied. Her position was a delicate
one, and it required art and cleverness to balance
her smiles and words so that neither should fancy the
other to be the one most favored. Sparkfair was
chatting in his airy manner with a beautiful girl by the
name of Agnes Locke. Nevertheless, it seemed that
he occasionally cast faintly regretful glances in the
direction of June and Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack Randall talked confidentially with Barbara, and,
save Dick himself, it was possible no one present knew
their exact relations. Suddenly Steele rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A toast!” he proposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A toast! a toast!” cried all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Casper lifted a glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll drink it in water, the favorite beverage of
the one to whom it will be given.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>They all rose, each with an uplifted glass of water.
There was a hush, and, with a grave smile, Casper
turned his eyes on the lad at June Arlington’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s to Dick Merriwell,” he said. “Here’s to his
friends and his foes; may his friends never falter in
their loyalty, and may his foes soon realize their folly
and become his friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Splendid! splendid!” was the cry as they drank the
toast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick thanked Casper in a clever little speech, his
face flushed and his heart warmed by it all. It was
Randall who proposed the next toast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s to Yale,” he bowed; “Yale, Harvard’s beloved
rival. May the blue ever flutter high above all
other colors save the crimson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to attach an amendment to that,” laughed
Dick. “May the best team win, and, if it does, the
blue has no fear of finding itself looking up to the
crimson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wait until your freshman baseball team goes
against our freshies!” cried Randall. “You know we
have a slab wizard by the name of Sparkfair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep it dark, keep it dark!” came in a hoarse whisper
from Dale. “Don’t put the enemy wise. Let him
march unsuspecting to the slaughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll have to tell how I happened to bring
Spark with me to Meadwold,” he said, as the entire
party was again seated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t bear to have you tell,” objected Dale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This reckless young blade,” said Jack, “has injected
himself into all sorts of trouble since descending
on Cambridge. He seems to enjoy trouble with a keen
and fiendish enjoyment. The rackets he has been in
would fill a three-volume novel. Repeatedly he has
escaped disasters by a hair’s breadth. His last escapade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>proved rather more serious than the others. He
stole a cinnamon bear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tut, tut!” remonstrated Sparkfair. “State the
facts, Randall—the bear conceived an overweening affection
for me, and insisted on following me like a
dog.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Insisted on following you after you had fed him
a two-pound box of chocolates and bon-bons,” said
Jack. “It was this way: An Italian organ grinder
brought a tame dancing bear into town. The dago did
a lively business around Harvard Square, for the bear
was really amusing, and the students coughed up their
spare coins to see him do his stunts. Some time in
mid-afternoon the bear’s master tied him to a tree on
Massachusetts Avenue, and went into a restaurant for
something to eat. About this time Sparkfair hove
upon the horizon and espied bruin. Dale had purchased
an extravagant amount of candy for some one
of his numerous lady loves. He took a notion to offer
the bear a chocolate drop, and bruin keenly appreciated
the favor. For some time Spark continued to deal
out confectionery to the beast, and with each fresh
chocolate or bon-bon the bear’s liking for Dale increased
by leaps and bounds. Just how bruin’s chain
came unhitched from the tree I’m unable to say. At
any rate, when Spark started to depart the cinnamon
waddled after him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a frightful moment,” put in Dale. “Imagine
my sensation of horror when I realized that I was
being pursued by a real bear. Of course, I wouldn’t
have minded so much if it had been one of those Teddy
things that they sell at a toy store, but this was the
real stuff, with genuine hair on it. It had claws and
teeth, too. At first I was tempted to fly for my life,
but I didn’t know just how fast that bear could sprint,
and, therefore, I was afraid to make a start. In order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to appease the monster I opened up my second box of
sweets and handed him out a few more chocolates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” chuckled Randall. “Behold Sparkfair,
in your mind, backing down Mt. Auburn Street
with the bear sniffing along after him and licking its
chops for more chocolates. It seems that Spark has
a sophomore friend whom he greatly admires that
rooms in Claverly. This sophomore’s name is Coakley.
Up to date I believe he and Spark have practiced
the manly art of self-defense on each other at
least four times. Coakley has lost one of his front
teeth, and for a week or so Sparkfair was proudly displaying
a beautiful black eye. Well, what do you think
Spark did? When he reached Claverly he proceeded
to decoy that bear into the building and upstairs to
Coakley’s room. It happened that Coakley was out,
but his door was unlocked. Spark got the bear inside,
and then heartlessly abandoned the poor beast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not until I had fed him the last bon-bon in that
two-pound lot,” sighed Spark, with amusing dolefulness.
“I know a girl who went hungry for candy that
night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coakley returned to his room in the dusk of early
evening,” Randall continued. “He walked right in,
without anticipating the welcome he was to receive.
The bear was asleep on Coakley’s best Turkish rug.
I don’t think Coakley saw him. At any rate, he fell
over bruin, who rose with a grunt of disapproval. A
moment later other fellows in Claverly were horrified
by the most fearsome, heart-rending scream of terror
that ever smote mortal ears. Coakley yelled murder
and made a scramble to get away from the bear. Evidently
bruin fancied his friend with the candied delicacies
had returned, for he tried to embrace Coakley.
As I room in Claverly myself, I happened to see the
finish. Coakley ripped open his door and came gasping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and tumbling into the hall. A furry figure lumbered
after him. Coakley slid downstairs, and the bear imitated
his example. Confused and terrified, Coakley
made the mistake of dashing into the swimming room.
Bruin kept close at his heels until, with a last despairing
howl of anguish, Coakley plunged headlong into
the tank. The bear sat down on the edge and grinned
with pleasure as he watched Coakley splashing and
blowing about in the water. I think Coakley was in
that tank something like three quarters of an hour before
some one brought the bear’s master, who took
bruin away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unfortunately, some one saw Sparkfair decoying
the bear into Claverly. Coakley has sworn vengeance.
An investigation is threatened. There is a tinge of
blood on the moon in Cambridge. I thought it would
be best for Spark to get away for a couple of days,
and therefore I’ve inflicted him on this otherwise respectable
party.”</p>

  <h2 id='VI' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BLACKMAILER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After dinner music and merriment resounded
through the many rooms of Meadwold. The guests
were free to go wherever they chose, and all seemed
to feel perfectly at home. A little group had gathered
around a girl who was seated at the piano, and Jack
Randall led in the familiar songs of old Harvard,
being joined by both boys and girls in the choruses.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the servants found Casper Steele and spoke
a low word to him. Steele left the room, and was
absent a few minutes. Returning, he sought for Sparkfair,
whom he found chatting in his airiest manner
with Agnes Locke, who was holding her own with
him in the way of persiflage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Begging the girl’s pardon, Casper drew Spark aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s a friend of yours in the next room, Sparkfair,”
he said. “He’s just arrived, and seems very
anxious to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s natural,” said Dale. “My friends can’t bear
to be separated from me. It breaks their hearts. Did
he send in his autograph?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told me to tell you that he was a classmate
from Cambridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will flee to him on the wings of the morning—no,
I mean the wings of the evening. It’s too late
for this morning, and too early for to-morrow morning.
But say, old man, don’t let any giddy youth get
away with my find, Miss Locke. We’ve been flinging
bon mots and chunks of scintillating conversation at
each other, and at the present time she has me pretty
nearly backed off the map. After holding converse
with my friend from Cambridge I’m going out into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>cool night air and think up a few neat ones to spring
on Miss Locke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Spark danced into the adjoining room, but stopped
as if shot when his eyes fell on the new arrival. This
was a fellow about Dale’s age, with restless black eyes,
an unnaturally pale face, and startlingly red lips. He
was dressed in a spring suit of the latest cut and most
popular style. He wore a bright red necktie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hanks!” breathed Spark, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s me,” nodded the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a single moment Sparkfair had seemed staggered.
He recovered quickly, and assumed his usual
air of nonchalance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you lost, strayed, or stolen, Hanksy?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I guess not,” was the answer, with a touch of
insolence in both manner and tone; “but I was afraid
you might become lost if I didn’t take pains to look
you up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was distressingly kind of you, Hanksy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cut out the Hanksy. You can’t afford to be too
flip with me just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t afford much of anything since the squeezing
you gave me,” confessed Spark. “My dear fellow,
you’re certainly destined to become a millionaire, or a
stone breaker in an institution for people who are too
eager to acquire sudden wealth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None of that,” advised Hanks. “It doesn’t sound
well from a chap who was caught in a piece of gumshoe
work that would have done credit to a second-story
man. You can’t throw any stones, Mr. Dale
Sparkfair. If you do, you’re liable to get a few of
your own windows broken. I don’t wonder that you
ducked out of Cambridge in a hurry, but you made
a mistake in thinking you could get away without settling
with yours truly, Jimmy Hanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Didn’t you see Hunnewell after I left?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks permitted his red lips to curve contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not making any settlement through a third
party. I propose to do business with you direct, my
boy. Hunnewell chased me round, but I declined to
enter into dealings with him. I found out where you
had gone, and decided to take a little vacation myself,
and look you up. I am here. Now, take my advice
and be good. Unless you do, your goose is cooked at
Harvard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you find an elevated platform somewhere
and tell people about it?” chirped Dale. “Hadn’t
you better hire a hall?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t want your friends here to hear any of
our conversation, you might step outside with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to step outside. I’d like to see you in some
quiet, secluded spot where I could put a few dents in
your face, Hanks!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you want to try that on, you have my permission,
but you know what will follow. I have the
proofs, Sparkfair—I have witnesses. You were
caught with the goods. I’m not choosing this as the
proper place to discuss the matter. If you wish to
maintain secrecy, there’s a fine veranda and a broad
lawn outdoors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no time to talk of such things,” protested
Dale, doing his best to hide the annoyance and exasperation
which threatened to get the upper hand. “If
you wish to see me to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t. To-morrow I return to Cambridge.
We’ll come to an understanding to-night. If not, you’ll
be a fool if you ever again show your head at Harvard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As long as you’re so urgent,” smiled Spark, “I suppose
I’ll have to give you a modicum of my valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>time. Toddle along, Hanksy, and I will follow your
lead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A couple who happened to be standing on the veranda
saw them come out of the house and stroll away
on the lawn, chatting freely in a way that was deceptive
in its seeming friendliness. It happened, also,
that Jack Randall had seen them leave the house, and
had recognized the fellow with Sparkfair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the dickens does that mean?” muttered Randall.
“That was Hanks. Where did he come from,
and what is he doing here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack was tempted to follow them, but finally decided
not to do so. Some twenty minutes later Sparkfair
reappeared in the house and sought Jack, whom he
drew apart from the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Randall, old man,” said Dale, “I’d like to borrow
a little filthy lucre. Have you some molding simoleons
in your clothes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you want of money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, that’s not nice, you know. If a friend asks
you for a loan you should submit gracefully and without
question to the holdup. I’m sure to pay you if
I ever raise the dough. If I don’t, you may rest assured
that you have performed a worthy action in
contributing to the peace of mind of a distressed comrade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t spend any money here, Spark. How
do you expect to get rid of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to plug up a rat hole with it. I’ve got
to plug that hole, or the rat will eat my cheese. Now,
don’t—don’t distress me by further inquiry. Don’t
you observe the beads of cold and clammy perspiration
upon my noble brow? Can’t you detect the haunting
terror in my eye with fine frenzy rolling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what you want with the money.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Tell me not in mournful numbers that this can
be true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw Jim Hanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’m on. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lingering near, like the vulture awaiting the feast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s under this roof?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I expect the shingles of Meadwold shelter him at
this moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dishonest crook, he ought to be kicked out!
I’ll see that he is kicked out at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dale grasped Randall’s arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be not too hasty in your violent resentment against
this pernicious person,” implored Spark. “You can’t
kick him to-night, Randy, without hitting me. He has
me nailed to the wall, and it’s useless to squirm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you going to let that blackmailer squeeze money
out of you?” indignantly demanded Randall. “I
wouldn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I refuse, he’ll proclaim to the world my iniquities.
I can’t stand for that to-night, Jack. I’ve got
to choke him off, and there’s only one way to do it.
For goodness’ sake, let me have a paltry one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So he demands a hundred, does he? He’s modest!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Modesty is no name for it,” grinned Dale, still
endeavoring to be cheerful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And this is only the beginning, Sparkfair. If you
give in to him now, he’ll suck you dry. You’ll have
to pay hush money to that fellow whenever he demands
it. You’ll become his slave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless I find some way to trip him. All I want
is a little time, Randall, and I’ll find a way. In order
to get time, I’ve got to hoist the white flag at present.
You know where I’d stand if this fellow should tell a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>few things in the presence of the assembled merrymakers.
I can get rid of him at once by forking over
the sum he demands. If you don’t help me out, I
shall have to give Merriwell the touch, and perhaps he
hasn’t that amount in his jeans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It certainly galls me to see you stand for blackmail,
Sparkfair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It can’t gall you any worse than it does me, but
when a fellow’s guilty he has to cough if the blackmailer
puts on the screws. Let’s not procrastinate. I
want to hasten Hanks forth into the coolness of the
outer air. The knowledge that he is beneath this roof
hangs over me like a fog.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think he’ll go if he gets the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says he will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t do this for any one else, Sparkfair. I
haven’t the money in my pocket, but I’ll get it for
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, a thousand thanks,” said Dale. “I’m so
deeply moved that I fear I may fall on your bosom
and weep. I won’t forget it, Randall. On my word,
I won’t. I’m going to get a twist on Hanks if I live,
and I’ll find a way to squirm out of his grip. While
I’m planning such a coup I’ll have to soothe him with
the long green. I’ll tell him he shall have it directly,
but don’t be too long in providing the needful, old
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry. If he thinks he’s going to get a
hundred, he’ll keep his face closed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall turned away, while Dale once more sought
Hanks.</p>

  <h2 id='VII' class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>BEHIND THE PALMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Ensconced behind some palms, Dick and June were
enjoying a delightful chat. They had a hundred things
to tell each other, and June was vainly trying to tell
it all at once. From their nook they could see Buckhart
happily occupied with Mabel Ditson, and apparently
satisfied for the time being that he had stolen
a lap on Claxton. Chester Arlington seemed to be a
favorite with the girls, and he appeared happiest with
several of them near.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think my brother is looking well, Dick?”
asked June.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never saw him looking finer in my life,” was the
answer. “The West must have done him good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know it did, but Chester says he owes all the
benefit he has received to your brother Frank. He
has told me of the most wonderful adventures in company
with Frank. You know he was seriously wounded
down in Mexico. A bullet grazed his skull, and he
was out of his mind for some time. Frank took care
of him and brought him back to Wellsburg. Chester
has been training in Frank’s athletic school, and I feel
confident now that he’s finally succeeded in breaking
away from his old bad habits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sincerely hope he has.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says you, Dick, were the one who started him
on the right road that summer, up in the Blue Hills.
Oh, that summer in the Blue Hills! I’ll never forget
it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” said Dick. “It was jolly and strenuous
and exciting enough to satisfy the most adventurous
tastes. How is Madge Morgan?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“I knew you’d ask. That was almost the first question
Dale Sparkfair had for me. Madge is fine. She’s
attending school in Bloomfield, you know. We have
rooms together. Oh, she’s a splendid girl, Dick. She’s
so kind and thoughtful toward her poor old blind
father. He’s there living quietly in a home provided
for him by some good people. Madge sees him almost
every day. She’s the only person he has to live for
now, and I know his one fear is that he will lose her
somehow. That fear is groundless, though. She’ll
never be parted from him in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I understand her as I think I do,” nodded
Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wasn’t it the greatest fortune that Chester and I
succeeded in inducing father to let us come on with
him? We planned to surprise you in New Haven, but
when we met Casper Steele, and he found we knew
you so well, he made arrangements for this surprise
party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A surprise it was,” laughed Dick. “The greatest
surprise and the most delightful one of my life. Why,
I really thought I must be dreaming when we stopped
at the door and I saw you there on the steps. I wish
you could have seen yourself beneath the light of those
Japanese lanterns, June. I used to think you pretty,
but I declare when I saw you to-night you looked a
thousand times——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now stop—please stop!” she protested, quickly
placing a soft palm over his lips. “Don’t try to flatter
me like that, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The truth may never be called flattery. I had the
queerest feeling as I stared at you. I don’t wonder
Sparkfair said I was asleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you weren’t, were you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” admitted Dick. “I’m afraid I was.
I’m almost afraid I’m still slumbering.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Then you’d better wake up,” laughed the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will!” he suddenly exclaimed, and, screened by
the palms, he kissed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She caught her breath with a little gasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that’s the way you wake up, hadn’t you better
go to sleep again?” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so, for that is the realization of my
dreams, June.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They both tingled with an unspeakable, undefinable
pleasure that was wholly innocent and harmless.
Tommy Tucker, with a tall, dark-haired girl, peered in
upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Peekaboo!” cried Tommy. “Caught you. Say,
Dick, what makes you monopolize the only secluded
retreat there is in this room? Can’t you give a fellow
a show?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Tucker!” exclaimed the tall brunette reprovingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Call me Tommy, Janette—please call me Tommy,”
pleaded the little chap. “And don’t for the love of
decorum hitch Mister onto my name. I have to stop
and think who you mean when you do. Nobody ever
calls me Mister. All my friends insult me by calling
me ‘Runt’ and ‘Shaver’ and ‘Sawed-off,’ and offensive
names like that. I’ve threatened vengeance on them a
thousand times, but it doesn’t seem to frighten them
a bit. I wish I was seven feet tall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s a chap in Chicago, Tommy, who advertises
to increase a person’s height from an inch to two
inches,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if I can’t put on more than an inch or two,”
declared Tucker, “I’ll let myself remain a sawed-off.
What’s the good of stretching one’s self for a paltry
inch of stature? Say, Dick, won’t you give me the
signal when you decide to move? I have a secret
which I wish to whisper in the shell-like ear of Janette.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>It can’t be told where the morbidly curious would be
liable to overhear a word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll move at once,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t permit Mr. Tucker to disturb you,” said Janette.
“I think his secret will keep a while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, cruel maiden!” cried Tommy dramatically.
“Would you keep the pent-up emotion of my heart
burning itself out with a lambent flame? Gee, but that
was a good one! Wonder how I happened to think of
it? I can’t always trace these brilliant ideas which
occasionally flash from the bubbling fountain of my
intelligence. They’re really going, Janette. Let’s rest.
Let’s ensconce ourselves. Let’s modestly retire from
the public gaze.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the tall brunette was obdurate, and Tommy
could not inveigle her behind the palms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must look like a dangerous devil,” said Tucker
fiercely. “Never saw a girl that wasn’t scared to death
to get out of sight with me for ten seconds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give you a pointer,” smiled Janette. “Don’t let
them know you’re so dreadfully anxious to get out of
sight with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never thought of that,” confessed the little chap.
“Say, Janette, let’s stand under the chandelier a while.
I’m awfully timid, you know. I wouldn’t go behind
those palms for the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, in a mock whisper, he murmured to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if it will work?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re the silliest little chap!” exclaimed the
amused girl. “I suppose, now, you expect me to seize
you bodily and drag you behind the palms. You’ve
got a lot to learn, Tommy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless you! bless you!” panted Tucker, beaming
with gratitude. “You didn’t say mister.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again he resorted to an aside in a hoarse stage
whisper:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“I’ve got her coming. She’s mine if I don’t make a
misstep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Janette began to laugh, and her merriment increased
until she almost gasped for breath. Indeed, she seemed
to lose her strength to such an extent that Tucker hurried
to offer his support, and a moment later they
found themselves on the secluded seat behind the
palms.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Two of the rooms of the old house had been converted
into one, which was now the dance room of
Meadwold. This was thrown open, and the alluring
strains of the orchestra brought the young people
flocking to the polished floor. Having left Mabel Ditson
for a moment, Buckhart hastened to look for her
at the first strains of the dreamy waltz, and was filled
with consternation on discovering her just whirling
onto the floor with Claxton. Some one touched Brad
on the arm as he stood glowering after the lucky Virginian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t give yourself away like that,” said the voice
of Barbara Midhurst. “Why, you look ready to eat
some one up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see a gent from Virginia that I feel it my solemn
duty to assassinate,” growled the Westerner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Mabel Ditson the only girl here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is sure the only one for me,” admitted Brad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t you any finesse?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. Down in Texas we don’t run to
that a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I gave you credit for more artfulness, Brad. The
first time you met Mabel you were on your guard, and
you upset all her preconceived notions of you. Don’t
spoil it all to-night. You can’t keep her to yourself
every minute of the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I notice my pard is hanging onto June Arlington
right solid. There they are waltzing together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he hasn’t seen her for a long time. It’s different
with you and Mabel. Now, look at Jack and
me. Where is he? I haven’t the remotest idea. Brad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Buckhart, if you don’t dance with me I shall be a wall
flower. You’re going to dance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I am,” said Brad submissively. “I hope
you can stand for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you’re really a splendid waltzer,” said Bab,
after they had swept once round the floor. “Somehow,
I didn’t fancy you were.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s it,” he muttered, “and I’ll bet Mabel thought
the same. If that’s the case, I won’t trouble her. I’ll
dance with somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bab laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are the most jealous, touchy person I ever saw,
Brad Buckhart. Why, you’re worse than the Virginian
you dislike so much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t dislike him, begging your pardon. I thought
I did once, but I guess he’s all right in his way. We
don’t tie to each other a whole lot, but there’s no longer
any hard feelings. We have planted the tomahawk.
If Mabel likes him better than she does me, she sure
can have him as much as she wants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dale Sparkfair and Agnes Locke swung past them.
Spark was laughing and chattering as if he had not
a care in the world. Certainly, trouble sat lightly on
the shoulders of this irresponsible fellow. Nevertheless,
Spark caught his breath on passing the wide door
of the dance room and discovering Jim Hanks standing
there, hands in pockets, serenely following Dale
with his dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack Randall appeared in the door a few moments
later. At the conclusion of the waltz Sparkfair excused
himself and joined Randall. They moved way.
Hanks leisurely turning to watch them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s the money,” said Randall, slipping the roll
into Dale’s hand. “Get that fellow out of here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll chase him out with great alacrity and unspeakable
glee,” said Dale. “Leave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>But when he signalled for Hanks to follow him the
intruder seemed utterly oblivious to his meaning. Dale
was compelled to walk up to Hanks and speak to him
in a low tone. This was precisely what Hanks wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” he said, “here you are, Spark, old chap,
Didn’t know what had become of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I noticed that,” scoffed Dale. “You were looking
right at me, but you didn’t see me. If you want to
close that business, just stroll outside for a moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chester Arlington, having abandoned cigarettes, had
wandered out onto the veranda to whiff a cigar. Lighting
the weed, he was tempted to stroll down across the
lawn, and finally seated himself in a shrub-sheltered
arbor. Two minutes later two persons stopped near
this arbor. They were Sparkfair and Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you succeeded in raising the wind, did you?”
chuckled the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I succeeded in raising the wind,” answered
Dale, “and, having done so, I expect you to fan the
wind with your heels. Your room is much preferable
to your company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’m enjoying myself,” chuckled Hanks. “It’s
really a jolly little party. I wouldn’t mind staying and
joining the gay throng.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you won’t,” said Dale, with a grimness in his
voice. “Having blackmailed me to the tune of a hundred,
you’ll promptly hit the high places.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I haven’t seen the hundred yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The word blackmail had caused Chester to check
himself in the act of coughing, to give them notice
that he was sitting near. He now listened with great
interest, peering forth at the dark figures to be seen
behind the shrubbery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It feels like the real stuff,” laughed Hanks, with
satisfaction. “Are you certain it’s an even hundred?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“I didn’t count it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I think I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks struck a match and held it with one hand
while he thumbed over the money with his other hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Four twenties, a ten, and two fives,” he said triumphantly.
“That’s quite right, Spark, old chap. It
looks like good money, too. I need it in my business,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know why you should, for you’ve certainly
fleeced enough greenhorns to be good and flush. I
caught you at your crooked game and exposed you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did make something of a fuss,” acknowledged
Hanks, as he dropped the expiring match. “You
seemed to have me on the hip just then, but a little
later you made a bad mess for yourself. Of course, I
shall stand by my agreement and say nothing about
that. I’ll likewise keep silent the two friends who
were with me when we caught you sacking my room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you caught me trying to recover some of my
goods which you had beaten me out of,” said Dale
hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were the watch and the ring we found on you
goods of yours?” sneered Hanks. “If I remember
right, the watch bore my monogram, and I think I can
prove that I bought the ring with my own money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With the money you had cheated your victims
out of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were doing a little fine burglar work, Spark.
You can’t deny that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I took that watch and ring with the idea of holding
them until I could force you to give up my property.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a nice little excuse, Sparkfair, but it happened
that several other fellows who had never obtained
any of your property recently lost valuable articles
from their rooms. It was believed that the thief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>was a college man, and it was freely stated that he
would be expelled and punished if detected. You know
well enough what is coming to you if I ever tell or
permit my friends to tell how you were caught.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll not take the pains to deny that I am the suspected
thief,” said Dale. “I have hopes that the real
thief will be found.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a pretty little bluff,” sneered Hanks, “but it
doesn’t go with me. Now, don’t get excited. Don’t
make any fighting talk. You won’t fight, because you
don’t dare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at present,” acknowledged Dale. “But my time
will come. I’m going back to the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go with me? You agreed to leave the moment I
gave you that money! Aren’t you going to keep that
agreement?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I meant to keep it when I made it,” said Hanks.
“But since then I’ve changed my mind. I’m going
back to the house with you, and you’ll introduce me
to your friends. I think I shall enjoy myself very
much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On my word, I’ll wear stripes before I’ll ever introduce
you to any of my friends!” flared Dale, as he
whirled and strode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll see about that,” muttered Hanks, following
promptly. “I think another twist of the screws will
bring you to terms.”</p>

  <h2 id='IX' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>ARLINGTON TAKES A HAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Arlington rose and stepped out from behind the
shrubbery, standing where he could watch the two
figures passing beneath the glow of the many Japanese
lanterns. He saw Sparkfair mount the steps and enter
the house without once turning his head toward the
chap who kept so close at his heels. Hanks brazenly
followed, and likewise disappeared beyond the hospitable
door of Meadwold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Chet, taking his cigar from his lips and
tapping it to knock off the ashes, “my friend Spark
seems to have gotten himself into a deuce of a mess.
Reminds me of myself in the old days. I was always
getting into some sort of a scrape like that. I sympathize
with him, hanged if I don’t! Spark is a jolly
good fellow. He is reckless and regardless of consequences,
and that’s the way I used to be. Used to be?
Perhaps I haven’t fully gotten over it yet. I’m hoping
I have, but one never can tell. If deviltry is in the
blood, it’s liable to break out any old time. Evidently
this blackmailer has Sparkfair dead to rights. He
caught Dale in a position that makes Spark look like
a sneak thief. He’s got Spark going, and he’s bound
to squeeze him good and hard. I think I’ll have to
take a little interest in Mr. Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll have to see what I can do for my friend.
From what I overheard it’s evident that Hanks is something
of a card sharp. I should say he has been skinning
Sparkfair and other fellows at Harvard. Probably
he thinks he’s too clever to make a slip and be exposed
in his crookedness, although Sparkfair claims
to have caught him. It’s likely Spark couldn’t prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>his claim that Hanks was cheating. I’ve been up
against card sharps all over the country, and I think
I know their tricks. Although I should prefer to forget
it, I’ve practiced a few tricks myself. Really, I’d
enjoy a nice, sociable little game with Mr. Hanks. I’d
enjoy having him try some of his slick tricks on me.
Yes, I have decided that I’ll cultivate the acquaintance
of Hanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Flinging away his partly smoked cigar, Chester returned
to the house. The music of a two-step and the
rhythmical sound of gliding feet came from the ballroom.
Arlington slowly sauntered in that direction,
keeping his eyes open for Hanks. He found the fellow
just inside the door, watching the dancers. Without
hesitation, Chester spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello,” said Chet, “you don’t seem to be dancing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks showed some surprise in being addressed in
this manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’m not dancing,” he answered. “You see,
I’m a late arrival here, and I haven’t met many of the
young ladies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you weren’t at dinner? Somehow, I didn’t
remember seeing you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I missed the spread. By Jove! that’s a peach
of a pretty girl!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The one my friend Sparkfair is dancing with. Do
you know her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chester’s eyes found Dale and his partner in the
moving throng upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I know her,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s her name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“June Arlington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that’s a pretty name. On my word, she’s
the queen to-night. I’d like to meet her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“You bet I would!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps your friend Sparkfair will give you an
introduction?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t know about that,” he confessed.
“You see, Spark and I have lately been mixed up in
an unfortunate tiff. Of course, it doesn’t amount to
anything, but he might be narrow and refuse to give
me a knockdown to that girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you any other particular friends here this
evening?” asked Chet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there’s Randall—I know him. He’s a Harvard
man. I’m a Harvard man, you understand. I
suppose you’re an Eli?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet. I expect to enter Yale next fall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, say, couldn’t you put me next to that stunning
girl with the dark eyes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I might if we were better acquainted,” said Chester.
“Let’s go up to the smoking room and have a
little chat. There’s plenty of time to dance later. Come
on, old man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He passed his arm through that of Hanks, and led
the fellow away. They mounted the stairs and entered
the smoking room, where they found one of
Casper Steele’s chums, Fred Harmford, enjoying a
cigarette. Harmford was the only fellow in the smoking
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Arlington!” called Fred. “Going to smoke?
Have a coffin nail out of my collection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He proffered his cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you,” smiled Chester. “I’ve cut those
things out. I prefer cigars when I smoke now, and
I’m careful not to hit them up too hard. Getting back
into form, you understand. Expect to enter Yale in
the fall, and I’m going in for athletics.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>By this time he had found Steele’s well-filled cigar
urn, and offered it to his new companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excuse me,” said Hanks, as he took a cigar, “did
I get your name right when that fellow spoke to you?
Is your name Arlington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any relation to the beautiful girl with the glorious
dark eyes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, by Jove! this is one on me!” laughed Hanks.
“Here I was asking you if you knew her! Say, a
fellow with a sister like that ought to feel proud enough
to blow up. I think she’s the handsomest girl I ever
set eyes on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re quite extravagant in your admiration,” said
Chester, waving Hanks to a comfortable chair, although
he felt like punching him in the eye. “Sit down,
old fellow. But first hadn’t you better shake hands
with Mr. Harmford? Harmford, this is Mr. Hanks,
of Harvard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They made themselves comfortable before the
faintly glowing embers on the hearth of the open fireplace.
The music, softened and subdued by distance,
floated faintly to their ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does it happen you’re not dancing, Harmford?”
inquired Chet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t care much for dancing—never did. I prefer
some less strenuous form of amusement. Now, if
some one would only start up a set at bridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or poker,” laughed Arlington. “That’s the game
for genuine amusement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks had pricked up his ears, and was showing the
greatest interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poker is a good game,” he said. “A man’s game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you play?” asked Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, occasionally—just for amusement, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“I understand. Of course, we all play just for
amusement. We don’t play to stick our friends, or
anything of that sort. If we had a crowd, and were
certain of no intrusion, I’d like to play a little game
now. Would you come in, Harmford?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the limit was made reasonable, I might sit in
for a short time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, here’s three of us,” said Chet. “That’s better
than no crowd at all. Of course, it isn’t as good
a game as more would make, but it will do. None
of the girls will come here, and I don’t think we need
to mind about the fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Steele might object,” said Harmford apprehensively.
“I wouldn’t think of starting a game without
his permission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you and Hanks make yourselves comfortable
and sociable while I look for Casper,” said Chester.
“Perhaps he’ll join us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doubt it,” said Harmford. “He’s too much interested
in a certain young lady. I don’t think he
would venture to leave her long enough to play poker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Arlington left the room, but returned within ten
minutes, bringing a fancy poker set, with a full supply
of chips and several packs of cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were right about Steele, Harmford,” he
said. “Casper said he couldn’t think of taking a hand.
Said he would have to keep around with the guests,
as it wouldn’t look well if he secluded himself for an
hour or more. He was perfectly willing we should
enjoy a little game here in the smoking room as long
as we do not pull away enough of the fellows to leave
any of the girls pining for partners. You know there
are several fellows more than girls in the party. Now,
let’s decline to take any one else into the game. Let’s
make it a little exclusive, three-cornered go. We’ll play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>for exactly an hour, and then we’ll quit. That’s long
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While speaking he had pushed a card table into position
beneath the softened glow of some electric lights.
The trio gathered round that table and settled down
for the game.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='X' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>A HOT OPENING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the limit?” asked Harmford. “What sort
of a game are we going to play?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What would you suggest?” inquired Hank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five-cent ante and quarter limit is good enough
for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tut! tut! tut!” cried Hank. “That’s a piker’s
game. You can’t play poker with that sort of a limit.
If you attempt to make a bluff, everybody’ll call you
for a quarter. If you open a pot, everybody’ll stay in
on short pairs. Isn’t that right, Arlington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve noticed,” answered Chester, “that a fellow generally
loses as much with a five-cent ante and a quarter
limit as he does with the same ante and a dollar limit—that
is, if he knows how to play poker. The dollar
limit really makes it a good game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whew!” whistled Harmford; “that’s pretty near
the roof for me. Let me see, I don’t believe I’ve got
more than twenty-five or thirty dollars in my clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s good while it lasts,” grinned Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it’s settled as a dollar limit, is it?” said Chet.
“We’ll call the blue chips a dollar, the reds a quarter,
and the whites a nickel. I’ll be the banker. We’ll take
ten dollars’ worth of chips, each of us, to begin with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better take enough,” suggested Hanks. “Ten dollars’
worth wouldn’t last a fellow long if he happened
to get a good hand and found himself bucking against
some one else. Why don’t we take twenty-five dollars’
worth to start with?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As much as you choose,” said Chester, “only it’s
understood that the chips are paid for when I hand
them out. There’ll be no credit business done by the
banker this evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“And if the banker loses I suppose we’re to have
some assurance that he also will make good,” said
Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do precisely as you do,” assured Chester. “I’ll
pay for my chips and put the money in the card box
when I take them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that’s all right,” said Hanks, producing his
roll. “Here’s a yellow-backed twenty and a fiver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee whiz!” grunted Harmford, as he reluctantly
counted out twenty-five dollars. “This is plunging for
a little game to pass away the time. I’m liable to get
skinned to the bone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you get broke,” said Chester, “I’ll loan you
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is, if you don’t get busted, too,” grinned
Hanks. “Of course, that’s not likely to happen, but
still, in a three-handed game I’ve noticed that, as a
rule, one man is the winner and the other two are the
losers. I hope it’s my evening to win.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was skillfully rippling the cards as he spoke.
Having done this, he placed them on the table for the
cut.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lowest deals,” he said, “and ace is low.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I think I’ll deal,” laughed Harmford, turning
up an ace.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was right, and the game began, Arlington putting
up the first ante.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now let them dance their heads off,” said Chester.
“I’m better satisfied right here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks stayed on the very first deal, shoving out two
white chips, which raised Chet a nickel. Harmford
glanced at his cards and followed the Harvard man’s
example.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arlington promptly made it a quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s interesting,” said Hanks. “Seems to me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>we all caught something right off the reel. Wonder if
you could stand another quarter, Mr. Arlington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might try me and see,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jove, I will!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks pushed two red chips into the pot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That lets me out,” said Harmford. “Can’t chase
anything as hot as that on a pair of jacks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He threw down his cards and turned to Arlington,
wondering what Chester would do. Chester pushed
a blue chip into the pile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you make it a dollar?” inquired Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My money talks,” nodded Chet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’re going some! But you’ve just begun.
I’ll have to part with one of my blue babies, and I
think I’ll send another one along to keep it company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a bit over the limit,” reminded Chester.
“If you’ll pull down a couple of red ones, you’ll be
right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” said Hanks, as he secured two red chips,
“you’re correct, Arlington. I boost you an even dollar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have something good,” observed Chet,
with a faltering air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The show-down will tell whether I have or not.
On my word, I hate to win the first pot, but I have to
play these cards for all there is in them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry about taking the first pot,” said Chester.
“You haven’t taken it yet, have you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll just boost you another blue one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cæsar’s ghost!” exclaimed Harmford. “You fellows
are plunging too sudden, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the use to hold back when we have the
right stuff to make a hot start?” chuckled Hanks, his
eyes beginning to gleam with greed, although he tried
to conceal the look beneath his bushy eyebrows. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>suppose I’m a fool, Arlington, but you’ve got my dander
up. I’ll raise you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’ll raise you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’ll raise you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With each raise they pushed chips representing two
dollars into the pot, and before cards were drawn the
first twenty-five dollars’ worth of ivories had disappeared
from the place in front of them. It was Arlington
who finally quit boosting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help! help!” gasped Harmford. “This is awful!
This is the worst thing I ever saw! Thank goodness,
I didn’t get into that mess!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank goodness I did,” laughed Hanks. “How
many cards will you take, Arlington? Harmford is
ready to hand them out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can give them to Hanks, old man,” said Chester.
“I don’t think I need any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, wouldn’t that bump you!” grinned the Harvard
man. “Here I am in precisely the same fix. I
don’t need a card.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they stared at each other as if seeking to read
an inkling of the truth in the expression of their faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>One way in which a poker player seeks to judge the
strength of an opponent’s hand is by the opponent’s
draw. In this case neither Hanks nor Chet received
any such hint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Harvard man produced his money, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll have to have twenty-five dollars’ worth
of chips, Arlington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chester quietly counted them out, taking the proffered
money and making change.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to have the same amount,” he nodded.
“I’m bound to keep even with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lock the door! lock the door!” palpitated Harmford.
“Who’s armed? Who’s got a pistol? Let him
give it up before there’s any further betting.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“I always carry a pistol,” laughed Hanks, “but I’ve
never had occasion to use it. Certainly I can’t think it
necessary now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more the betting was taken up, and not until
fully fifty dollars had been put into the pot by each of
them was a call made. At length, Chester announced
that he was satisfied, and that he would call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A touch of cold feet?” murmured Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m the one that’s got cold feet,” confessed Harmford.
“On my word, my teeth are chattering. Do
hurry up and show your hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you may take it back,” said Hanks, still
keeping his eyes on Chester. “You may go on betting
if you wish to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve called,” nodded Chester grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How large is your straight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t a straight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Then how large is your flush?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t a flush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it must be a full hand!” cried Hanks. “But
I think my full house is good enough. Just take a look
at it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spread out three aces and a pair of queens.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does that look to you?” he inquired triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pretty good,” nodded Chester. “How do these
look to you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lay down a king and four ten spots.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Hanks stared at the cards displayed by Arlington,
and then he swore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did you get them?” he finally demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harmford dealt them to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Harmford is a friend of yours!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No insinuation, I hope?” murmured Chester, an
ugly flash in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think it mighty strange you got a hand
like that against this ace full of mine?” rasped Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it was rather odd,” admitted Chester. “But
still, I must repeat that I hope you’re not insinuating.
To begin with, I wish you to understand that Harmford
is not a particular friend of mine. I met him
for the first time in my life to-day at Meadwold. We
have never played cards together before. If you’re
not satisfied, Mr. Hanks——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am!” snapped Hanks, picking up the cards and
pushing them across the table. “The pot is yours,
Arlington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said Chester suavely, as he raked in
the chips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now give me fifty dollars’ worth of those chips,”
said the defeated chap, as he flashed his money once
more. “I want you to understand that I’m after you,
Arlington. I’m going to even up for this devilish
streak of yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forewarned is forearmed,” laughed Chet, counting
out the chips. “Here you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And here’s your money,” said Hanks, tossing it
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I won’t dare breathe in this game,” murmured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Harmford. “I certainly didn’t know what I
was getting into.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you want to get out,” said Hanks, “Mr. Arlington
and I can continue alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t get out, Harmford,” entreated Chester.
“That would spoil the game. Mr. Hanks will feel better
after he’s won a pot or two. He seems to be easily
disturbed over a little matter like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you’ve seen plenty of games opened with
hands just like those,” sneered Hanks. “If you have,
you began playing with a cold deck. The cards were
stacked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t mean such was the case in this game,”
said Harmford, “for you shuffled the cards before we
cut for deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not making any claims whatever. Let’s forget
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three or four hands were played without any further
excitement. Harmford won two small pots, which
put him slightly ahead. Hanks sat grimly glowering
from beneath his shaggy eyebrows. He was biding his
time, feeling determined to get back at Arlington by
hook or by crook. Finally, on an interesting jack pot,
all three players remained, Hanks having opened.
Hanks won this pot with three kings, Harmford having
three trays, and Arlington two pairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just a flea bite,” observed the Harvard man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it leaves me about even,” said Harmford.
“Guess I’ve got a couple of dollars of somebody’s
money here, but that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On Arlington’s next deal things happened. Harmford
discovered three sixes in his hand and made a bet.
Chester stayed in without taking up his cards. Hanks
raised Harmford. Those three sixes looked good, and
Fred came back with another raise.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Arlington had examined his hand. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>now added to the excitement by raising a blue chip.
Hanks studied his hand a few moments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll stay right with you people,” he observed.
“I’ll have to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you don’t raise?” inquired Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” said Harmford, making good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks took one card. Harmford took two, but
failed to better his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think one will be enough for me,” said Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>The card Chet drew would have improved Harmford’s
hand, for it was the fourth six spot. It did not
improve Arlington’s hand, for Chester already held
four eight spots.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harmford bet a dollar. Arlington raised a dollar.
Hanks pushed out three blue ones. Harmford began
to look disgusted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One or both of you fellows filled your hands,” he
observed, glaring at the three sixes he held. “What’s
the use for me to stick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may be bluffing,” grinned Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you’re both bluffing, I’ll let you fight it out between
you!” snapped Harmford, flinging down his
cards. As he tossed them on the board one of those
cards was faced, but he quickly covered it with his
hand and turned it down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s up to you, Mr. Arlington,” nodded Hanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that case I shall have to give you another boost,”
said Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>They continued to raise each other until Hanks had
exhausted his supply of chips. Plunging down into
his pockets, he raked up all the money he possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s twenty-two dollars,” he said. “Give me that
amount in ivories. That’s my last dollar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In such a case,” said Arlington, “I should advise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>you not to press the betting any further. You may
need some money to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry about me,” said Hanks. “I have you
beaten this time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chester accepted the money and counted out the
chips. While he was doing this Jack Randall and Casper
Steele wandered into the room and paused near
the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How’s the game going?” inquired Steele.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too hot for me,” confessed Harmford. “I just
dropped threes to let these two crazy chaps buck each
other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What threes did you hold?” inquired Casper, leaning
over Harmford.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harmford whispered the answer in Steele’s ear.
Having secured more chips, Hanks resumed betting,
quite unaware that Jack Randall stood directly behind
him. Chester followed Hanks up until the fellow had
pushed in his last chip and was compelled to call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d never call in the world if I could borrow some
money,” he said. “I’ve got you beaten, Arlington, old
fellow. You’re trimmed this time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you beat four eights?” inquired Chester, as he
spread out his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Easy,” laughed Hanks. “Here’s a beautiful
straight flush. Just take a look at that dusky array
of spades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cards exposed by him were the three, four, five,
six, and seven of spades.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That looks pretty good,” said Chester; “but what
card was it you picked up out of the discard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly Hanks flew into a rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?” he snarled. “Do you accuse
me of cheating?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw you steal a card from the discards,” declared
Arlington grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“It’s a lie!” snarled Hanks fiercely. “It’s a trick to
beat me, but I won’t stand for it! I’ve won that money
fairly, and I’m going to have it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute, wait a minute!” exclaimed Harmford,
who had just made a startling discovery. “Arlington
holds four eight spots and a six, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” nodded Hanks; “but I hold a straight flush,
and that wins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait,” repeated Harmford. “Let’s examine this
pack. There must be too many cards in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too many cards? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have the six spot of spades in your hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I started the betting on three sixes. When I quit I
threw them into the discards. That makes it seem
that there are five sixes in the pack, or, as Arlington
claims, you secured one of mine from the discards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harmford just informed me,” said Steele, “that he
had dropped three sixes. Let’s take a look at the discards,
gentlemen. If there’s cheating here, we want
to know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of himself, Hanks turned pale, for he realized
that he was trapped. He sought to hide his dismay
and alarm by a great amount of bluster, but Steele
sternly commanded him to be silent. The discards
were inspected, and only two six spots were discovered
among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That settles it,” said Steele, his eyes fastened on
Hanks. “This fellow came here without invitation,
and he has remained without invitation. He’s a card
sharp and a cheat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t true,” protested Hanks. “There’s a mistake
somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time Jack Randall spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, Hanks,” he said. “There’s a mistake,
and you made it. You tried your old trick of cheating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>but you overstepped yourself. Gentlemen, this
fellow is known at Harvard as a crook. He’s likewise
a contemptible blackmailer. Shall we kick him out,
Steele? I’d like the pleasure of booting him myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him get out as quietly as possible,” urged Casper.
“We don’t wish to raise a disturbance. We don’t
wish to alarm the girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re getting off mighty easy, Hanks,” said Randall.
“Hereafter, I think you’ll find Cambridge a
most disagreeable place for you. Perhaps you hadn’t
better remain there longer than to pack up your belongings
and depart quietly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks had risen to his feet, and he faced Jack defiantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go back to Cambridge and stay as long as I
please,” he declared. “You can’t drive me out. If you
try it, you know what will happen to your freshman
friend, Mr. Sparkfair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do urge him to go hastily, Steele,” implored Randall,
“for if he doesn’t, I’ll certainly have to kick him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanks was followed down the stairs by the entire
party. His hat and coat were handed him at the door,
and he passed out into the night without a dollar in
his pocket and with rage and longing for revenge filling
his heart.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Chester found Sparkfair chatting with June.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t mind, sis,” he laughed, “I’ll relieve
you of this noisy insect. I’ll take him away and give
your ears a rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re wonderfully cocksure about that,” said
Dale. “Perhaps I’ll decline to be torn away. This
is the first time I’ve been able to find June when she
didn’t have Dick Merriwell hanging around her. If
I leave her for ten seconds, he’ll swoop down on her
again. I don’t know where he is this minute, but I’ll
wager he’s watching his opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps he is with another girl now,” laughed
Chester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe it possible,” said Spark. “There
are no other girls for him while June is near.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to see you just a minute or two on a matter
of some importance,” said Chet. “June will wait
for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you, June?” asked Spark anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” she laughed, “I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Arlington had drawn Sparkfair aside, he drew
from his pocket a wad of money and began counting
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A fellow you know,” he murmured, “sent this
money back to you by me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh?” exclaimed Spark. “What is it, stage money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, it’s the real stuff. Here, I believe that is
an even hundred. Take it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to enlighten me still further,” muttered
Dale, as Arlington thrust the money into his
grasp. “You have me a bit twisted, Chet.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“It’s yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible! I haven’t had so much money of my
own for months.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tut! tut!” remonstrated Arlington. “I happen to
know a thing or two. That’s the money you paid a
fellow by the name of Hanks in order to keep his
mouth closed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sparkfair could not help looking startled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hanks!” he exclaimed. “What do you know about
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know a great deal about him,” laughed Chet,
“and I reckon he knows a few things about me. That’s
the very money you coughed up to him. He decided to
leave it with me before taking his departure from
Meadwold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he gone?” asked Spark anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone. Skidooed. Faded away. Vamosed, as they
say in the West. You’ll see no more of him this evening,
at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For which relief I must confess I’m truly thankful,”
said Spark. “But you’ve got me guessing, Chester.
What do you know about any deal between Hanks
and myself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Arlington was enjoying the mystification of his
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know Hanks is a crook and a card sharp,” he
answered. “I know he has been cheating you at
poker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” said Dale. “Don’t speak so loud. If Merriwell
should find it out——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I won’t blow on you, old fellow,” laughed
Chester. “I’ve been there myself too many times. I
can sympathize with you, my boy. I know how it feels
to be skinned by a cheating poker player, but I haven’t
experienced anything like that for some time. After
passing through a few experiences, I decided to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the skinning myself. With that object in view I
learned all the crooked tricks of the game, and since
then I’ve had the satisfaction of stabbing several gentlemen
who were trying to knife me. It’s disreputable
business, Sparkfair. A man who gambles at cards
will learn to cheat sooner or later. He has to do it
or remain a sucker for the sharks to skin. You found
out Jim Hanks was skinning you. It made you hot
when you realized how you had been robbed. You had
even put up your watch and some other valuables to
raise money. Hanks had loaned you the money you
wanted, and then won it back from you. When you
found out he was dishonest, you boiled with indignation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boiled, sizzled, steamed, blew up,” said Dale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Precisely. You made up your mind that the valuables
he had secured from you were still rightfully
your property. You slipped into his room to see if
you couldn’t find them. You didn’t find them, and
this made you still hotter. You decided to take a few
trinkets of his and hold them until he coughed up your
own property. Unfortunately, Hank and a couple of
friends dropped on you before you could get out of his
room. They caught you with the goods. Now, Mr.
Hanks has been blackmailing you. For some reason
he’s short of money of late, and, therefore, he chased
you down here, thinking it possible you might not return
to college after that cinnamon-bear escapade, and
feeling determined to get a last crack at you. He
squeezed a hundred dollars out of you this evening
under threat of exposing you before the company
here. I’ve recovered that hundred, and you have it
in your hand. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it isn’t all,” said Dale. “How the dickens do
you happen to know so much about this business?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t keep you guessing any longer,” said Chet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and he told Sparkfair how it was he happened to know
so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how did you get the money from him? How
did you force him to give it up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was easy,” chuckled Chester. “Hanksy thinks
himself clever at poker, but he has lots of tricks to
learn. I’ve played the game from Fardale to Mexico.
I’ve been up against all kinds of crooks, and I’ve
learned some tricks never dreamed of by Hanksy. It
didn’t hurt my conscience a bit to work some of those
tricks on him this evening. I inveigled him into a
little three-cornered game, Fred Harmford serving as
the dummy most of the time. Most of the fighting
was between Hanks and myself. Harmford broke
about even. I had luck at the very start, for the first
deal gave me a top hand over a full house by Hanks.
This enabled me hastily to relieve him of about half
the money you had handed over to him a short time
before. That made him ugly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was bound to get at me somehow, but he overstepped
himself by stealing the six spot of spades from
the discards. The stolen card gave him a straight flush
against four eights held by me. But you see, Steele
and Randall had dropped in on us, and I was able to
prove that Hanks stole the card. That was his finish.
He had bet his last red cent, and a few moments ago
he was quietly escorted outside by Steele. He didn’t
make any fuss about it, for he was afraid to do so.
He’s gone, Sparkfair. You have the hush money he
squeezed out of you, and you needn’t worry about being
bothered by him again to-night. There’s June still
waiting for you, and the orchestra is starting another
waltz. So long, old chap. Enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Refusing to hear any words of thanks, Arlington
turned away, and Dale hastened back to June.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In spite of herself, June could not help wondering
what had become of Dick. After dancing again with
Dale, she listened to his suggestion that they should
stroll out onto the veranda. There were other couples
outside, and, having paused near a corner, June’s keen
ears detected the sound of a faint familiar voice. Dick
was near at hand, speaking earnestly with a girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know you can trust me, Bab,” he was saying.
“The secret is safe. Have I ever failed you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Dick,” was the answer. “You’re a dear good
fellow. Really. I feel like hugging you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>June’s hand closed convulsively on Dale’s arm, and
she turned away. Sparkfair had caught a bit of this
conversation, which was not intended for their ears,
and, strangely enough, instead of feeling elated, he was
seized by a sudden paroxysm of indignation toward
Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, confound him for a scoundrel!” thought
Spark. “I didn’t think it of him. He’s got another
girl on the string, and there’s a secret between them.
If I get a good opportunity, I’ll have to give him my
opinion of his conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s walk down across the lawn, Dale,” said June,
suddenly anxious to get away from the house. “I
don’t think I’ll dance any more to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time in his life Sparkfair, usually glib
of tongue, was at a loss for words. He felt awkward
and embarrassed, and every moment it seemed that his
indignation toward Merriwell increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should be careful, June,” he finally said.
“You are very warm, and your dress is thin. You may
catch cold. You may get pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I don’t care if I do!” she exclaimed bitterly.
“Really, I think it would be fine to have pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I say, June, that’s ridiculous. Now you’re
talking like me. You’re just saying that to hear yourself
say something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean it, Dale. I’m never ill, anyhow. Nothing
ever happens to me. Occasionally I get thin and ethereal,
but that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They sauntered past the shrubbery behind which
Arlington had listened some time before to the words
of Spark and Hanks. Once more some one was hidden
behind that shrubbery. A pair of restless dark eyes
peered out at Spark and the girl. A pair of very red
lips softly whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Sparkfair, and that’s Arlington’s sister with
him. Curse Arlington! I’ll get even with him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Crouchingly, the fellow slipped to the shelter of another
cluster of shrubbery. In this manner he followed
the couple some distance. At last they paused and
turned back toward the house. As they passed a thick
rosebush a pantherish figure leaped onto Sparkfair’s
back and hurled him fiercely to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dale was stunned and rendered helpless. The assailant,
who had a handkerchief tied over the lower
part of his face, whirled and caught June Arlington
in his arms. She uttered a scream of terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, my beauty—squawk away!” laughed the
fellow hoarsely. “You’re the prettiest girl I’ve seen
in a year, and I’m going to kiss you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He attempted to lift the handkerchief in order to
accomplish his purpose, but she fought him with such
fury that he was overcome by surprise. With a snatch
she tore the handkerchief from his face and flung it
to the grass. Still it was too dark for her to see his
features distinctly. By this time the girl’s fight<a id='t70'></a> had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>been answered. Voices were calling to her, and running
feet were thudding across the lawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guess I’ll have to lose that kiss!” panted the ruffian.
“Never mind, I’ll get it some other time!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But when he attempted to free himself and take to
his heels, the girl held fast and battled him in spite of
all he could do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help!” she cried. “Quick! This way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later she felt a pair of strong hands tear
her free from the scoundrel, who was instantly flung
face downward upon the ground and pinned there with
the knee of Dick Merriwell driven between his shoulder
blades. Steele, Buckhart, Randall, and several
others came hurrying to the spot and surrounded
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sparkfair had revived and was sitting up, although
bewildered and dazed to such an extent that he could
not tell what had happened to him. June could tell,
however, and she explained in a very few words.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rage of those lads was boundless. Only for the
coolness of Merriwell, the captive might have been
vigorously manhandled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strike a match, somebody,” said Dick. “Let’s get
a look at his face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A match flared in Buckhart’s hands. Protected by
Brad’s curving palms, its light was flung on the face
of the captured rascal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On my word, it’s Hanksy!” breathed Sparkfair.
“Why, Hanksy, you shouldn’t get so careless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Attacked you, did he, Sparkfair?” cried Casper
Steele. “Assaulted you and Miss Arlington, eh? Had
a handkerchief tied over his face when he did it, did
he? A pretty serious piece of business. I think it
ought to give Mr. Jim Hanks a nice little vacation behind
some good strong iron bars. Tie his hands, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Hold on! hold on!” protested Hanks. “What are
you going to do with me? I didn’t mean to hurt anybody
but Sparkfair, and I’ve got a grudge against him.
Here, Sparkfair, speak up for me. If you don’t, I’ll
tell them what I know about you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead,” said Dale defiantly. “I doubt if any
one would believe you now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captured ruffian’s hands were pinioned, and he
was marched back to the house. On the veranda the
girls were gathered, vaguely and apprehensively speculating
on the cause of those startling cries for help.
Beneath the light of the Japanese lanterns they made
a beautiful group, in dresses of white and pink and
light blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall was sent to reassure the girls, while the
captive was marched along toward the stable. Reaching
the stable, Hanks was bound and thrust into a
box stall, the door being fastened upon him. Steele
called one of the stablemen and gave him instructions
to guard the captive cautiously and faithfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, fellows,” laughed Casper, “we’ll go back to
the girls and forget that there’s been anything to mar
the pleasure of the evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the house, Dick inquired for June.
He was told that she was in her room, and they assured
him that she had not been harmed. It was fully
half an hour before June reappeared in the ballroom.
He had been watching for her, and hastened without
delay to join her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust you’re all right, June,” he said. “I was
afraid that scoundrel had hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m all right,” she answered, with surprising coolness.
“I was not harmed in the least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have been frightened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naturally, I was frightened somewhat, but I’m all
right now.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Will you dance any more?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then this waltz—let’s——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” she said. “There’s Dale. I
am to dance with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She gave Sparkfair a signal and moved toward him,
leaving Dick feeling perplexed and hurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must dance with me this time, Dale,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the ears of Midas, I can’t!” he gasped, in dismay.
“I’ve engaged Janette Brice, and she has her eye
on me this minute, June.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then get me a partner and be quick about it,” June
urged. “Don’t leave me alone more than twenty seconds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Out shot Dale’s arm, and he collared Harmford,
who was passing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here you are,” said Spark. “Fine girl, fine fellow.
Go it. You know Mr. Harmford, June.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goodness!” gasped Harmford, as Spark hustled
away. “Is that his style of doing things? Will you
dance with me, Miss Arlington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>June was ready to dance with any one save Dick.
She knew Dick was watching her, and as she whirled
onto the floor with Harmford she was filled with a
feeling of satisfaction, for it seemed that she had retaliated,
in a measure, for the deception of Merriwell.
As for Dick, he was simply filled with astonishment,
being utterly unable to understand what it meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sparkfair has stolen a march on me,” he decided.
“Well, if June is as fickle as that, he may have her.
I’ll show her that there are others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this resolution in mind, he found another partner,
and, thereafter, during the remainder of the evening
he and June did not dance together.</p>

  <h2 id='XIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the morning the hostler came to Steele and sheepishly
informed him that some time during the night
the captive had slipped his bonds, managed to get out
of the box stall, and escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how he did it, sor,” said the hostler. “I
wisht you’d tell me how he opened the door of the
stall from the inside, sor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have slept like a log, Killen,” said Casper.
“I’m sorry the fellow got away, but perhaps it
saved the trouble of prosecuting him. I don’t believe
he’ll show his nose in Cambridge again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfast, with the morning sun streaming in at the
windows of the dining room, was a jolly affair. Of
course it was not what might be called an early breakfast,
but before nine o’clock every one of the guests
was up and ready to sit down at table.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now Dick found that, in some manner, June’s
seat had been changed. She was no longer at his side,
but Sparkfair had the pleasure of discovering her
beside him. Outwardly, Dick did not seem a bit disturbed.
He chatted and laughed as easily as ever. The
girl who filled June’s former seat received Dick’s smiling
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plans for the day were freely discussed, and new
projects were proposed, until Steele laughingly reminded
them that they had suggested enough things
to keep them all busy for a week, at least.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s for a ride?” cried Agnes Locke. “Casper
has a stable full of saddle horses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I accept the challenge,” came quickly from Arlington.
“You can’t shake me, Miss Locke, I’m with
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“And I think I’ll go, too,” said June. “Will you
come along, Dale?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will I? Ask me,” laughed Sparkfair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you’d like to join them, Merriwell,” said
Steele. “I have a fine black thoroughbred that it would
do your soul good to mount. I have plenty of riding
togs. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I wouldn’t think of forcing myself on
such a satisfactorily arranged party,” laughed Dick.
“Still, Steele, I’d like to bestride your thoroughbred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s there another girl to balance the party?”
cried Sparkfair.</p>

<p class='c007'>June touched his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” she murmured. “Are you going to insist
on inviting Dick Merriwell to join us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if you don’t want him,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, it happened that less than an hour after
breakfast two lads and two girls rode out from Meadwold,
and Dick was not one of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, Merriwell had donned riding clothes
offered him by Steele, and the quartet had no more
than disappeared when he galloped out from the stable,
astride the black thoroughbred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sparkfair found June in a nervous, excitable mood.
Several times he detected her looking back over her
shoulder as if half expecting to discover some one in
pursuit of them. In truth, she was looking for Dick,
but he had taken another course, and there was no
chance that he would come upon them from the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t get over the nervous feeling caused by that
affair last night,” said June. “I was dreadfully frightened
when that scoundrel leaped upon us from behind
the rosebush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you proved yourself a heroine, June. You
hung to him and yelled bloody murder until the fellows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>came up and nabbed him. At first I was sorry
when I learned this morning that he’d escaped in the
night. Now I’m rather glad of it. It saves us the
trouble of pressing the case against him, and I don’t believe
he’ll go back to Cambridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he does——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he does, I may have further trouble with him,
but I’m not worrying over that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a time Arlington and Agnes fell behind. Beneath
some trees by the roadside they halted, and soon
Dale and June passed from view. Finally discovering
that their companions were not following closely, they
drew rein and waited for them to come up. June was
seized by a strange desire to be alone for a time, at
least.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you’d go back and look for them, Dale,”
she said. “Please do. You can overtake me. I’ll
wait for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus urged, he finally turned back. She permitted
her horse to move along slowly, the rein lying loose
upon its neck. She was buried in deep thought when
a sheep suddenly started up by the roadside and gave
the horse a fright. An inexperienced horsewoman
would have been thrown from the saddle by the sidelong
leap of the animal. June maintained her seat and
caught up the reins. But the horse had the bit between
his teeth. With ears set flat back, he was running
away. Through a gate he tore, and away across
an open field the girl was carried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell, cutting across that field to reach the highway,
saw what had happened. Immediately he headed
the black thoroughbred in pursuit of the runaway. It
was a wild and thrilling race, for neither walls nor
fences nor ditches could check the frightened animal
that was bearing June. Over them all he sailed. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>girl heard some one shouting to her, and, half turning
her head, she caught a glimpse of the pursuer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dick!” she breathed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she could not understand his words, although
she fancied they contained a warning. Ahead of her
loomed another stone wall. She wondered if the runaway
would not be turned by it. Not until the animal
was sailing over that wall did she realize what
lay beyond it. A moment later horse and girl struck
with a mighty splash in the placid water of a small
river.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carried from the saddle, June rose to the surface
just in time to see the black horse bearing Dick Merriwell
come flying over the wall above her.</p>

<p class='c007'>What followed seemed like a dream to June. She
knew Dick clutched her with his strong hand, and she
had good sense enough to give herself up without
struggle or effort, so that he was finally able to bring
her unharmed to the low bank on the far side of the
little river.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horses had swam out and were grazing in companionable
contentment upon the grass as Dick and
June, dripping wet, sat on the bank and looked at each
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Merriwell, with a light laugh, “I hope
this doesn’t give you a cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope it does!” she cried. “I told Dale last night
that I wanted to catch cold and have pneumonia and
die. Now this is my chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It surely is,” agreed Dick. “But why this sudden
morbid desire for death? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ought to know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve deceived me, Dick. I heard you last night—I
heard you talking to that girl they call Barbara
Midhurst. You were speaking about a secret between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>you. If you like her better than you do me, I’m sure
you’re welcome to her. I don’t care. I’m glad of it!
I hope you’ll live long and both be happy. I’m going
to die, anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I hope it isn’t quite as serious as that, June,”
he laughed. “I’m glad I know what was the matter.
Yes, there is a secret between Barbara Midhurst and
myself, but I give you my word that the secret concerns
a third party. I discovered it by accident, and I’ve
kept it for her sake and the sake of the third party. I
don’t care for Barbara, June—that is, not as you mean.
Don’t you believe me? Did I ever tell you a lie in my
life? You’re the girl I care for more than all others
in the world. Can’t you trust me? What’s the matter?
You’re crying!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m all we-wet, and fuf-feel just per-perfectly
horrid!” sobbed June.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you think I’m a two-faced scoundrel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No-no I don’t. I tried to think that, but now I
know I was fuf-foolish. I’m ashamed of myself, Dick.
I can’t help crying, and I haven’t even got a dry handkerchief
to wipe my eyes with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” he said, glancing around to make sure no
one was in sight. “Never mind the handkerchief.
Let this dry your tears.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And behind the palms they kissed and the misunderstanding
was at an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day the house party dispersed, Dick and
his friends returning to Yale to resume active work
in their baseball work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick had not been in New Haven two hours before
he heard news that worried him. He learned that
some one had sold the baseball team’s signals to the
enemy. He quickly discovered the guilty person, and,
knowing that no further useful steps could be taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>in the matter, he told his friends that the incident was
closed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the incident was not closed. For the guilty
man’s friends took the matter up. Not knowing that
Dick Merriwell already knew the identity of the traitor,
they resolved to capture Tommy Tucker for the purpose
of forcing him to sign a supposed confession.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 id='XV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ABANDONED CAPTIVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Try as he might, he could not make a sound louder
than a smothered, choking groan. After repeated attempts
to shout he gave it up in despair, although the
cords which bound him to the chair had been drawn
so tight that they were cutting into his limbs and stopping
the circulation of his blood, and the thick cloth
tied over his mouth was nearly smothering him.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the wall at his right projected a feebly fluttering
gas jet. The faint light, flickering on the face
of the captive, showed him to be a slight, slender, undersized
lad some seventeen or eighteen years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Tommy Tucker, and the freshman was in a
decidedly unpleasant and apparently serious situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning along a dark block after having seen a
charming and interesting girl to the door of her home,
Tucker was suddenly pounced upon by three or four
fellows, who seized him, flung a blanket over his head,
tripped him up, sat on him, and held him helpless
until a cab drew up at the curb. The victim was
bundled into the cab and carried away. After his first
efforts at resistance he made very little struggle, realizing
it was folly to fight against such odds.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time his assailants had pulled the blanket off
him inside the cab Tucker was feebly gasping for
breath. The curtains were closely drawn, and it was
so dark in the cab that he could not discern anything
whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gug-golly!” he gasped, catching his breath. “I’d
been cooked in ten seconds more. I was almost smothered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I always did like smothered chicken, ta-ra-tum,”
sang a hoarse voice in Tommy’s ear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Shut up!” snarled another voice. “Don’t talk—don’t
anybody talk! I love silence. I adore silence.
I will have silence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush-h-h-h-h!” breathed Tommy. “Be still as any
mouse. But, say, permit me to inquire what the dickens
you fellows are trying to do. Are you kidnaping
me with the idea of holding me for a ransom? If
you are, permit me to inform you that you’ve captured
the wrong kid. There are no millions in my family,
and I believe my father would feel actual relief if
some one should be foolish enough to take me away
where I wouldn’t bother him any more. Or are you
some poor, deluded sophomores who contemplate having
real fun with me? If such is the case——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he doesn’t shut up, blanket him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if you’re going to do that, I’ll keep mum,”
said Tucker hastily. “Please don’t put that thing over
my head again. Refrain, and I’ll close up like a clam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>How far he was carried in the cab Tucker had no
accurate means of telling. Finally the cab stopped.
An instant later the blanket was again wrapped tightly
about the captive’s head and shoulders. They dragged
him out and forced him along, stumbling and half-falling
down a flight of stairs. The sound of their
feet echoed gloomily in what seemed to be a big room.
The air was damp and stale, as Tucker quickly discovered
when the blanket was lifted in order that he might
get a breath. It was, likewise, dark as Erebus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although he was highly indignant over the treatment,
Tucker knew the uselessness of displaying anger
and resentment. He permitted them to force him
down upon a chair and tie him there, although he made
occasional calls for the lifting of the blanket in order
that he might breathe. Finally they cast the blanket
aside, but he was given no more than a glimpse of
them, for a bandage was quickly slipped over his eyes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The gas jet had been lighted, and they were working by
the aid of the wretched light thus provided.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll raise a howl,” said Tommy. “I think
I’ll yell bloody murder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Howl your head off,” said one of the captors
huskily. “You’re in the basement of Dinsmore &amp;
Hyde’s old warehouse. You might shout for a week
without any one happening to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will not rupture my voice,” said Tucker.
“But my unquenchable curiosity compels me to inquire
your motives and intentions. What are you going to
do with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll find out in time,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’m very impatient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This provoked a burst of suppressed, mocking
laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll get a fine lesson in patience to-night,”
Tucker was told. “It will do you good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the dickens is the use to tie those ropes so
tight? Old Samson couldn’t get away after being
trussed up like this, and I’m no relation to Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind his back one of the captors whispered a
hoarse question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long did you say a man could live without
food or water, captain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That depends,” was the wheezy answer. “Some
live longer and some live shorter. This little runt is
one of the kind that lives shorter. He won’t last more
than three or four days at most.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My golly!” exclaimed Tommy. “Are you going
to leave me without anything to eat or drink for three
or four days?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’ll be well enough to silence his tongue,” said the
wheezy voice. “Art ready, Eros?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, Charon,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then gag him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Tucker started to object, but his words were cut
short as they bound the thick cloth over his mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis well,” said one, when the task was finished.
“Now he is secure and silent. We can leave him, comrades.
Our direful work is well did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed I think we have dooded it well,” said another.
“But methinks it were best to leave his eyes
uncovered, captain. What say ye?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis well. Remove the bandage from the wretch’s
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When this was done Tommy looked around for
them, but heard the sound of retreating feet behind
him. Turning his head, he caught a glimpse of their
dark figures melting from view amid the dim, dusty,
and empty boxes at the far side of the room. Seized
by something like panic, he would have called to
them, but the muffling cloth prevented this. The sound
of their footfalls grew fainter and fainter. A door
creaked on its rusty hinges. A few moments later
the door closed with a slam, and the deserted lad
fancied he heard the grating of the bolt as it shot into
the socket.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the unfortunate boy it soon seemed that hours
had passed since his abandonment. Vainly he had
squirmed and twisted in an effort to free an arm or
a leg. Vainly he had worked his head and jaws,
trying to get his mouth clear of the bandage which
covered it. The silence that surrounded him seemed
appalling at first, but in time his ears detected a suspicious
rustling, which sent a chill through his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although he would not have acknowledged it,
Tucker was a chap who believed in the supernatural.
All his life he had been industriously looking to see
a spook in the dark. Up to date he had never seen the
genuine article, although on various occasions he had
fancied many material things to be of a ghostly nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Still, all these failures had not shaken his conviction
that some time he would see a real ghost.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now he remembered the gruesome tale that,
after being ruined by his partner, old man Hyde had
locked himself up in the basement of the big warehouse
and committed suicide. From that day a hoodoo
had seemed to hover over the building. Ignorant
people asserted that the warehouse was haunted. It
was finally abandoned, and for years the heirs of the
Dinsmore estate had been vainly trying to get it off
their hands at any old price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee whiz!” thought Tucker; “I’ll bet a cruller old
Hyde’s spook is prowling around here to-night.
Goodness, I thought I felt the touch of his fingers
then! Wish I had eyes in the back of my head. It’s
awful being able to see only one way. There it is
again! I know I heard something move.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly twisting his head off, he peered apprehensively
into the shadows. The gas jet continued to
flicker and flare, and, once when it died down and he
fancied it was going out, his heart nearly stopped
beating.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sque-e-e-eak!</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker’s hair stood at the sound, but in a twinkling
he felt something like relief, realizing at last that the
noise was made by a rat. This explained the mysterious
rustling he had heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I ever find out for certain just who those fellows
were, I’m going to murder the bunch of them,” decided
Tommy. “Talk about the tortures of the Inquisition!
This is worse! What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Something slipped past like a flitting shadow on the
cement floor. It was a scampering rat, but it had
given the captive an awful start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like rats,” thought Tucker. “They’re nasty
creatures, and sometimes they’re dangerous. Let’s see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>I think it was in ‘Les Miserables’ I read about the
sewer rats of Paris, big, hungry, creatures ready to
attack a man. Goodness, I hope these rats are well
fed! They’re getting altogether too friendly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For he had seen two or three others flit past him.
He was electrified by a shrill squeal close behind his
chair, followed by a scampering rustle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Deuce take ’em!” he mentally exclaimed. “They’ll
be climbing over me in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed it seemed so, for one big fellow advanced
boldly before him and sat up to inspect his appearance.
Tucker longed to hurl something at this old fellow,
who had a full set of grayish whiskers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The example of the old rat emboldened others, and
within a few moments they were frisking about
Tucker’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only for the gag Tommy would have yelled lustily.
He was covered with cold perspiration, while his mouth
seemed dry and parched. His eyes bulged with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of a sudden one of the rats made a leap and landed
on Tucker’s knee.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a convulsive twist, Tommy flung himself,
chair and all, over backward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 id='XVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>AN EVIL BAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With a terrific squeaking and scampering, the rats
fled in all directions. Tommy was both relieved and
dismayed. His position was now decidedly awkward
and painful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this keeps up long, I can see my finish,” he
thought. “Bet my hair’s begun to turn gray now.
A few hours more will make it white as the driven
snow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a time the rats began to return. He could see
them creeping out cautiously from the deeper darkness
which the flickering light did not penetrate.</p>

<p class='c007'>A faint rattling sound made him prick up his ears.
His heart throbbed, for something told him that some
one was fitting a key to the lock of the door. He was
right in this supposition, and soon the old door
creaked once more on its hinges.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a faint gleam of light, which moved
slowly amid the old empty boxes. Tucker heard the
sound of many feet, and finally a grotesque figure appeared,
bearing an iron pan with a long handle. On
the surface of this pan, which seemed half filled with
grease, a saturated rag was burning. It was a huge
candle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy blinked rapidly as his eyes perceived the
figure which bore the flaring light. Apparently it was
a huge bear, walking upright on its hind legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second later Tucker gasped again. Following the
bear, a gigantic bird that resembled an owl strutted
into view. Behind the owl came a turbaned Turk
with a curved sword in his hand. The Turk was followed
by a painted and grinning clown. On the heels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of the clown trod a crimson-clad, cloven-hoofed figure
which resembled Satan himself. Then came a somber
form in a long black cloak and high-peaked cowl.
This last person bore a huge broad-bladed ax in his
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker wondered if he was dreaming. As they
gathered around him he saw that Satan was carrying
a tinsmith’s hand furnace, in which a fire glowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hoo! hoo!” hooted the owl. “Look! See! He
has upset!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a fierce growl the bear waved the flaring light
in front of Tucker’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pick him up,” said the Turk, flourishing his sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him lie,” said Satan. “It comes natural for
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him lie,” said the one in black, as he flourished
the ax. “In this position I can easily lop off his
head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Restrain yourself, executioner,” chuckled the
clown. “We must have fun with him first. He must
answer my conundrum. Tell me, thou wretched creature,
why is a hen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back up,” said the bear, elbowing the clown aside.
“He can’t talk. Don’t you see he’s gagged?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who gagged him?” cried the clown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hoo? hoo?” hooted the owl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take hold, you imps,” commanded Satan. “Set
him upright.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chair was lifted and planted on its legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor fellow!” said Satan, with mock sympathy.
“See how frightened he is! Why, Turk, you could
hang your turban on his eyeballs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The executioner leaned on the handle of his ax.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some one remove the gag,” directed the wearer of
the crimson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hoo? hoo?” cried the owl.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“You! you!” commanded Satan, pointing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The huge bird complied, and Tommy, with great relief,
filled his lungs as the cloth was stripped away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Much obliged,” he said, his voice just a bit unsteady.
“If you go away again, please don’t close my
trap. The rats are a little too thick for comfort around
here, and I couldn’t even cuss at them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we leave you next time your tongue will be
silenced forever,” declared the executioner solemnly.
“With this good blade I shall sever your head from
your body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He flourished the ax as he spoke, swinging it with a
sidelong movement until the edge touched the captive’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boo! that’s pleasant!” shivered Tucker. “So
you’re going to decapitate me, are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” chuckled the clown, “we’re only going to cut
your head off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But first,” said the Turk, “we must examine your
feet. We have a peculiar notion that you are the unfortunate
possessor of extremely cold feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so,” nodded Satan. “Remove his shoes and
stockings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you take a hand, Sate,” piped the clown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, get busy,” said the bear. “I’m holding the
light. That’s my job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy’s ankles had been bound to the legs of a
chair, but now they were set free, and a few moments
later his shoes and stockings were stripped from his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed his tootsies are very, very cold,” said the
owl. “Start up the fire in your little furnace, Sate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Satan turned a thumbscrew which seemed to open a
valve of compressed air, for there was a hissing sound,
and the furnace began to glow almost at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the dickens does all this tomfoolery mean?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>demanded Tucker. “What are you trying to do with
me, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As Sate hath remarked,” said the Turk, “you’re an
easy-going liar. We are prepared to force the bitter
truth from your unwilling lips. A short time ago
some one sold the baseball signals of Umpty-ten to
the manager of a rival team. You, Thomas Jefferson
Tucker, were the miserable wretch who did that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, Turkey, old boy, are a liar by the clock!” flung
back Tommy. “I had nothing to do with it. I thought
that was proven long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing of the sort,” said Satan. “Your fine
friend, Richard Merriwell, induced a wretched bummer
to shoulder the blame of that piece of treachery,
but we happen to know that the bummer was paid to
clear you of stigma. While you have been cleared,
suspicion has continued to rest on another who is
innocent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you mean Bern Wolfe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have named him,” was the answer. “We
know Wolfe had nothing to do with that dirty business,
and we, likewise, know that you did. This very
night we caught you in company with the public
stenographer who made a typewritten copy of those
signals. After you escorted her home you were
brought here for treatment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha!” laughed the clown. “Treatment is an
elegant and appropriate word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have here,” continued Satan, producing a sheet
of paper, “a nice little typewritten confession of your
sins, which we expect you to sign. I’ve brought a
fountain pen for the purpose. In this document you
acknowledge that you are the traitor who gave the
signals to Ben Newhouse of the Hudson team. Would
you like to read it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care to waste my time,” said Tucker. “If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>you think you’re going to get my autograph hitched
onto the bottom of that document, you’re a bigger
fool than I ever took the devil to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cold feet,” snickered the clown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we have the facilities for warming them,” said
Satan. “Turk, kindly move the furnace a little nearer.
We’ll give his tootsies a nice comfortable baking. By
the time his toes are well done and crisp he may change
his mind and decide to append his signature to this
little document.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h2 id='XVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>TUCKER GETS WARMED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By this time the tiny furnace was glowing redly.
Its heat had reached Tucker, who made a wry face
as the Turk seized the handle and started to move the
furnace nearer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really,” said Tommy, “I think you kind gentlemen
are awfully obliging, but you’re greatly mistaken in
fancying me at all troubled with cold feet. I beseech
you not to disturb yourselves to warm me up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll do a great deal more begging before we
finish with you!” growled Satan. “Push the furnace
up close, Turk. Now get him by the ankle, clown—that’s
right. You take the other leg, Hooter. Hold
his feet extended so the bottoms will be thoroughly
warm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a sudden kick, Tucker upset both the clown
and the owl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” snarled
Satan. “Aren’t you strong enough to hold his feet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hoo? hoo?” cried the owl, scrambling up. “You
bet we are! If he kicks me again, I’ll warm his foot
by soaking it right plumb against the furnace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look!” grinned the clown, as Tommy began
making both feet fly like paddle wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll get tired of that in a minute,” said the crimson-clothed
imp. “Be ready to grab the instant he
lets up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In truth, Tommy was unable to keep up those kicking
movements for more than a few moments. He
soon began to pant, and the instant he ceased snapping
his bare feet through the air the owl seized an
ankle. On the opposite side the clown did the same,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and both clung fast with such strength that Tucker
could not jerk his feet away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, say, I don’t see any fun in this,” protested the
little chap. “Ouch! Thunderation, that’s warm! Look
out, you’ll have my Trilbys against the old thing!
Wow! wow! I can’t stand that. It’s too much! Oh,
say, let up, will you? If this is a joke, you’re carrying
it too far.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no joke,” grimly declared Satan. “We mean
business. When you fully understand that, you may
come to your senses and decide to sign this little confession
of your treachery to the baseball team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, give me a chance to think it over, will you?”
panted Tucker. “You’re blistering my feet now—on
my soul you are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s where we intend to blister them, on the
sole,” said the leader. “Lower his toddlers a moment,
boys. Let’s see if he is coming to his senses. But
keep a firm hold on his ankles. If he doesn’t agree
to our terms, we’ll warm him up again in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re very rude and cruel,” said Tucker. “Jinks,
I believe you did blister my feet! If you have, I’m
going to murder somebody! I’ll murder the whole
bunch of you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t he dangerous!” mocked the clown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better let me put an end to him,” said the executioner,
spitting on his hands and grasping the ax
handle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the flaring pan of burning grease the bear
grinned and yawned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do hurry up,” he said. “This confounded rig is
sweating me to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Evidently you know how I feel,” said Tommy.
“I’m perfectly willing to change places with you,
Teddy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come!” said Satan, flourishing the paper in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>front of the captive’s eyes. “Are you ready to sign
this confession?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What would it amount to if I did sign it?” sneered
Tucker. “You couldn’t make any use of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Couldn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I’d tell the truth and let everybody know
how I was forced into putting my name onto that lying
document. The moment one of you fellows showed it
he’d find himself in a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t think you’ll do anything of that sort,”
said the leader of the disguised chaps. “This is a fair
and square statement of the truth. You are the traitor
who betrayed the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a liar!” said Tommy, slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute, Tucker—you’ll get all that’s coming
to you if you don’t get humble. I say you betrayed
the team. I’m not the only one who believes it. Merriwell
saved your pelt by hiring a disreputable character
to take the blame on his own shoulders. Every
one knows that man Smith lied when he said he was
the one who stole the signals and gave them to the
manager of the Hudson team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think he lied myself,” said Tommy. “I’m satisfied
that some one on the team gave Smith the signals
and paid him to have them copied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’re that some one,” declared the Turk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll hand you out the same remark I just applied
to old Sate,” flashed the captive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to sign this paper,” asserted the wearer
of the crimson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I sign it,” said Tommy, “I’ll lose no time in
telling every one under what circumstances I was
forced into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“And if you tell any one that,” threatened Satan,
“you’ll get it again, and next time we’ll blister you
from your heels to the nape of your neck. We don’t
propose to make this confession public, but we’re going
to use it to force Merriwell and his friends to give
certain fellows of the freshman class a square deal at
baseball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And a sillier scheme I never heard of!” derided
Tucker. “You can’t force Dick Merriwell’s hand in
such a manner, and you ought to know it. Of course
I know you’re Merriwell’s classmates and enemies. I
think I could name you all. I’m dead sure I can name
four or five of you. It seems astonishing to me that
by this time you have not learned that Dick Merriwell
cannot be forced or browbeaten into anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you sign this paper?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I mean it because I realize that you’re just
fools enough to cook my feet unless I do sign.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Release his hands, boys,” directed Satan. “Stand
close around him and be ready to jump on him if he
makes a scrap of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not as big a fool as you fellows are,” mocked
Tommy. “You’re six to my one, and I have no idea
of scrapping.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few moments they set his hands free, and he
stretched and rubbed his arms with grunts of relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope some time I’ll have the pleasure of giving
a few of you fellows some of the same medicine I’ve
had to take to-night,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here,” said Satan, placing a short piece of board
across Tucker’s knees and spreading the confession
upon it. “Get ready to make your autograph. Here’s
a fountain pen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goodness! give me time,” urged Tucker. “How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>do you expect a fellow to write when his blood is
stagnated? Why, even my fingers are stiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Watch him,” warned the Turk. “He’s tricky.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The executioner lifted and poised the ax.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he tries any tricks,” he declared, “I’ll let him
have a taste of this where Nellie wore the beads.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker glanced around at all of those grotesque
figures and then twisted his face into a comical look
of disgust and resignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me the goose quill,” he said. “Here goes my
Thomas J. right at the bottom of this lying mess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Being a very little chap, Tommy wrote, like most
undersized persons, in a large, bold, flourishing hand.
In a moment he had dashed off his signature.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s my John Hancock,” he said. “I hope you
can see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The leader took the paper with a nod of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So far everything is satisfactory to us,” he
chuckled, folding the document and thrusting it into
a pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So far?” murmured Tommy questioningly. “Well,
I wonder how much farther you’re going? Isn’t this
about the limit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Satan made a gesture, and in another instant the
captive was once more seized and pinned fast to the
chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here! here!” he spluttered, in disgust. “What the
dickens are you up to now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re going to put you on your oath now,” announced
the leader. “We’re going to make you swear
by all things sacred, by all you hold dear, that you’ll
never tell under what circumstances you affixed your
signature to that document.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you make me sick, the whole of you!” said the
little chap. “I’ll never swear to anything of the sort.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“His feet are getting cold again,” snickered the
clown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead and warm them up,” directed Satan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tommy squirmed and twisted and yelled at the top
of his voice. In the midst of his struggles the basement
door was hurled open with a bang, and, shouting
loudly, a dozen boys, headed by Dick Merriwell, came
rushing to the rescue.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h2 id='XVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“This way! this way!” shouted the clear voice of
Merriwell. “Here they are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly Tucker was released by the startled and
dismayed fellows who had been torturing him. The
flaring light of a “slut” candle, aided by the dimly
flickering gas jet, showed the rescuers a most remarkable
group huddled there in the basement of that
old warehouse. The clown looked frightened; the
bear seemed ready to run; the Turk was crouching on
one knee and feeling blindly for his curved sword;
the executioner had dropped his broad-bladed ax; the
owl sought to edge away into the shadows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only Satan stood his ground boldly and defiantly.
In front of them all he stood with clenched fists, glaring
at the unexpected and unwelcome rescuers. The
flaring lights made him look very fierce and demon-like.
Involuntarily the rescuers halted and stared at
that remarkable group.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on!” yelled Tucker, giving the Turk a savage
jab in the ribs and upsetting the clown by kicking his
feet from beneath him. “Get into ’em, fellows! Give
’em fits! They’ve been giving me fits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got them foul,” declared Dick. “They’ll
have to surrender.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surrender?” snarled Satan. “Not on your life!
We’ll fight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fight they did. It was a fierce old battle that took
place down there in the warehouse basement. Dick
signaled out the crimson-clothed leader of the rascals
and engaged him. While they were tussling and writhing
and squirming, other struggles were taking place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>amid the boxes and bales and dim shadows of the
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell found his antagonist strong as a bull, but
was finally getting the best of the fellow when some
one kicked over the pot of grease, the “slut” candle.
The burning stuff ran flaring into a dry mass of straw
and excelsior. Fire leaped up in a twinkling, illuminating
the entire basement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Startled, the boys stopped in the midst of their
furious struggles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fire!” yelled one, in a tone of great alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s bad business!” panted Dick, tearing away
from his antagonist and leaping toward the flames.
“Quick, boys, let’s see if we can’t smother it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Satan, enraged by what had happened and utterly
reckless of consequences, sprang after Dick and grappled
with him again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You fool!” exclaimed Merriwell, twisting about.
“Let me alone! Don’t you see what’s happening?
The building will go up in flames!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let it go!” rasped the disguised fellow. “You’re
the cause, and I’m going to soak you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He struck Dick in the face, although the force of
the blow was partly broken by an upthrust arm. This
aroused young Merriwell and made him furious as a
wild creature. With a shout, he broke the fellow’s
hold upon him, seized the chap, snapped his heels into
the air, and whirled him headlong against the stone
wall. The crimson figure dropped limply to the cemented
floor and lay still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fellows, fellows!” shouted Dick, realizing that a
great many of the boys were taking to their heels and
getting out as quickly as possible. “Don’t run away.
We must smother this fire. We must put it out somehow.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>It was Buckhart who joined him, and they did their
best to put out the flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No use, partner,” said the Texan, “she’s got too
much headway. She’s bound to go. If we stay here,
we’ll be caught, and that will be mighty bad business
for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Dick—come on!” cried Bouncer Bigelow,
making frantic gestures. “Everybody else has
skipped. I’m going. You can’t do anything. Let
her burn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy ended with a choking, strangling cough,
for the place was rapidly filling with a thick volume
of pungent smoke. Brad seized Dick by the collar and
literally dragged him toward the door. Not until they
were in the outer air did Dick remember the crimson-clad
fellow he had last seen lying stunned at the foot
of the basement wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Follow me!” said Buckhart. “We must get away
lively.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took to his heels, covering the ground with
rapid strides and plunging into the darkness between
two buildings. Instead of following his friend, Dick
turned and rushed down the rotten basement stairs.
A volume of smoke met him, rolling forth from the
door and veiling the interior of the place. Through
this smoke the fire sent a dull lurid glow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stooping low, Dick plunged into the smoke. He
ran full against a huge box, but managed to grope
his way along until he could see the spreading flames
and feel their scorching heat. Through the yellowish
light he saw something moving. In a twinkling he
had the fellow by the shoulder. It was his crimson-clothed
antagonist, who had partly recovered and was
blindly trying to find the way out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This way!” wheezed Dick, pulling the bewildered
chap toward the door. “Hang onto me!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>They reached the door and started up the steps just
as a burst of fire behind them sent its flaring gleam
out into the darkness of the night. At the head of
the steps stood a huge man, on whose breast gleamed a
badge.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the night watchman of an adjoining lumber
yard. As Dick appeared he whipped out a revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on, you firebug!” he shouted. “Stop where
you are, or I’ll bore ye!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, plainly revealed by the flaring light of the
fire, he obtained a view of the demoniac, crimson-clothed
figure at Dick’s heels. To the superstitious
watchman it seemed like the Evil One himself, and,
with a howl of dismay, the man turned and took flight.
Merriwell was unspeakably relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was lucky for us,” he gasped. “Now we’d
better do some tall thinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking the chap he had rescued would follow
him, Dick imitated Buckhart’s example by choosing
the darkness between two wretched buildings, reached
an old board fence, skulked hurriedly along beside it,
came to the railroad tracks, and for the first time found
himself alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello!” he muttered. “That chap didn’t stick by
me. Well, I got him out, and I guess he can take
care of himself. That watchman will turn in a fire
alarm, of course. The healthy thing for me to do is
to get as far away from here as possible in a very
short time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He fled along the tracks until a crossing was reached
and he could leave the railroad. As he cut across an
open lot and set his course toward York Street he
heard the fire engines coming whistling on their way
to the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bad business! bad business!” muttered the boy. “I
don’t suppose any one will feel very sorry to see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>old warehouse burn, but still, I’d rather it would have
happened some other way. What if the lumber yard
takes fire also?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The question brought beads of perspiration out upon
his face. On the steps of the York Street house he
found Brad Buckhart and Tommy Tucker. The latter
was barefooted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost a good pair of shoes and some beautiful fifty-cent
stockings this evening,” said Tommy. “I can’t
afford it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great horn spoon, I’m glad to see you, partner!”
breathed the Texan, with unspeakable relief. “I
thought you right behind me until I hit the main highway.
When I discovered you weren’t with me I didn’t
know what to do. I thought of going back to look for
you, but that seemed foolish, for I knew you wouldn’t
turn round after getting out of that old building.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did turn round, though,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I happened to think of the fellow I pitched against
the wall and left stunned when we made haste to get
out. I didn’t really know whether he had escaped or
not. I went back to see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great tarantulas!” exploded Brad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re referring to old Sate, I presume?” said
Tucker. “Well, I really hope he got scorched a little.
He didn’t quite blister the bottoms of my feet, but I
thought he had.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fellow would have perished in that fire if I
hadn’t turned back to look for him,” said Dick. “I
got him out, all right, but we came mighty near being
nabbed by a night watchman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker snickered half hysterically on hearing Merriwell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>tell how the watchman had yelled and taken to
his heels at sight of the satanic figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tommy’s been telling me all about it,” said Buckhart.
“Why, those fellows were going to bake his
feet. We got there in the nick of time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I’d like to know,” said Tucker, “is how you
happened to get there at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to pledge you to keep it a secret,” said
Dick, “but there is a chap who used to be mighty
thick with that crowd, and he got onto the plot. He
gave me a tip, but made me swear I wouldn’t mention
his name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can guess,” chuckled Tucker. “It was Kid Lee.
Am I not right, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t I just stated,” said Merriwell, “that I
promised not to mention his name?”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 id='XIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE NEXT MORNING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Early the following morning Tommy Tucker, in
pajamas, came bouncing into Dick’s room. Merriwell
was already up. He had bathed and was partly
dressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pa-pore! pa-pore!” cried Tommy, flourishing a
newspaper. “All about de great fire last night! Dinsmore
&amp; Hyde’s old warehouse burned to de ground!
Pa-pore! pa-pore!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shut up, you yapping idiot!” cried Dick laughingly.
“Where’d you get the paper?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I fixed it with Maggie last night. Bribed her
to rise early this morn’ and hustle out for a newspaper.
She just left it at our door. See, here’s all
about the fire, Dick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Blessed Jones turned over in bed, jabbed his head
halfway under a pillow, and smotheredly droned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Him that disturbeth the sleep of the righteous let
him be condemned to fire and brimstone and let him
burn forever.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you were there, old snooker!” cried Tommy.
“You ought to be interested in this report. You were
with the gang last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buckhart stuck his head into the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Read it, Tucker,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus requested, Tommy read the account of the
fire which had destroyed the old warehouse and which
was believed beyond question to be the work of incendiaries.
Indeed, it was said that the watchman at
Gray S. Walpole’s lumber yard had detected two of
the firebugs in the act of leaving the basement of the
warehouse. According to the statement of Hatch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>one of these chaps had been dressed in bright red and
looked like the devil himself. The watchman acknowledged
that the appearance of this fellow so startled
him that he permitted them both to get a flying start,
and, in spite of his efforts to run them down, they had
managed to avoid him and escaped in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking of what had really happened when the
watchman saw that crimson-clad figure, Merriwell was
compelled to laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It says here,” said Tommy, “that the old building
was fully covered by insurance. I guess the owners
are mighty glad it burned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But not the insurance company, Tucker. Of
course that fire was an accident and we could prove it,
but it’s just as well for us if we can escape getting
mixed up in the business. If the fellows are wise,
they’ll keep still about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to read this to Big,” said Tommy, rising.
“See you later, fellows. Ta! ta!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell and Buckhart were ready to start out for
their usual morning walk, and Jones was sitting yawning
on the edge of the bed when callers arrived. They
were Jack Spratt, Otis Fitch, and Rob Claxton. Hearing
them come in, Tucker promptly appeared, followed
a moment later by Bouncer Bigelow, who was rubbing
his eyes and yawning, his uncombed hair standing up
like a topknot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you fellows seen the morning newspaper?”
was Claxton’s anxious inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” answered Tucker. “I took pains to provide
them with a few morning shivers by reading the report
of a fire that occurred last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was in hopes the firemen would be able to save
the building,” said Claxton. “I dislike very much to
think that I was in any way responsible for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You really were not responsible, Claxton,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Dick. “None of us fellows were. The really responsible
ones are the chaps who carried Tucker into the
basement of that building and attempted to have fun
with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gwathuth!” lisped Fitch. “I’ll never forget the
thtart I got when I thaw thothe fellowth. Wonder
where they got their cothtumes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you read about that in the paper?” asked
Tommy. “The shop of Julius Steiger, the costumer,
was broken into and looted last night. A number of
valuable costumes and wigs were stolen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which explains the astonishing disguises worn by
Tucker’s captors,” said Dick. “While I don’t fancy
being mixed up in this affair, I wouldn’t hesitate to
testify against those rascals if they were arrested.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what became of that document they persuaded
me to sign?” laughed Tommy. “If they ever
try to use that paper, it will be their prompt undoing.
Of course, old Sate has it in his possession. Oh, I’ll
see that chap again, and I’ll know him, too. I’ve got
a nice little razzer hidden up my sleeve for Mr. Sate.
If I ever get a good opportunity, I’m going to slice
him good and deep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You sus-seemed to cuc-cuc-come out of the bub-business
all right,” observed Spratt. “You don’t look
any the w-w-worse for wear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, thank you,” bubbled Tucker. “And
you, Spratt, are looking perfectly divine this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I haven’t a cent to my nun-name,” said Jack
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear boy, you misunderstand me!” cried
Tommy. “Can’t I pay a man a compliment without
wanting to borrow money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sus-suppose you can,” answered Spratt, “but sus-somehow
you nun-nun-never do.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Now that’s an insult!” snapped Tommy belligerently.
“I challenge you to a duel. Let’s not lose a
moment’s time. Let’s fight a duel right away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You needn’t lose any time,” laughed Dick. “It
only takes two seconds to fight a duel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker collapsed on a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was going to spring that myself,” he said dolefully.
“It must be awfully stale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” said Dick. “I thought I was stealing a
lap on you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have certain enemies, Tucker,” observed
Jones, “who seem determined that you shall not play
on the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thus far they’ve simply injured themselves,” said
Dick. “They must be disgusted with the way everything
has gone against them. We play Brown at
Providence, Saturday, and if we win that game it will
be the utter discomfiture of our enemies and the enemies
of the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we’ll win the game, partner,” said Buckhart
confidently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope we do,” nodded Dick; “but Brown has a hot
team, they say—the best freshman team she’s had in
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, how about uth?” inquired Otis Fitch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been generally reported that Yale has the
weakest freshman team she’s had in years, but I notice
we’ve been winning thus far.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even with Sam Kates in the box,” grunted Bigelow.
“Of course, you’re going to pitch Saturday,
Dick? You wouldn’t think of putting Kates against
Brown?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t put him against Brown. I shall wait
to hear what Captain Jones has to say.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“You’ll pitch, all right,” announced Blessed. “And
you’ll pitch the whole game, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” said Dick, “that seems to be settled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that settles the game,” asserted Spratt. “I’ll
bet my last dollar we win. It’s a sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better not bet,” said Dick. “There’s nothing like
a sure thing in baseball. I may have my off day—I
have one sometimes. Anyhow, I shall have to depend
on my backers. Without good backing I can’t hope to
get away with that game. Only for old Brad behind
the pan to steady me and assist me in working the batters
I fear I’d make a pretty poor showing. In most
cases the success of a pitcher depends on the sort of
catcher he works with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, dear, partner, let up on that!” exclaimed the
Texan, really confused. “You know you can pitch
ball without any old catcher at all behind the pan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I can pitch, but I can’t win games, Brad. To
win games I need the backing of the whole team, and
the man I depend on most is the man behind the bat.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='XX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>A PAIR OF RASCALS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the tinkle of his alarm clock Mike Lynch awoke,
opened one eye, squinted at the clock, and growled like
a flea-bitten dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rot it!” he muttered. “I haven’t had thirty minutes’
decent sleep all night long. Whew! whew! I can
taste smoke clean down to my toes. Got a bump as
big as half a watermelon here on the side of my head,
and the cords of my neck are stiff and sore. All I’ve
done is dream fire, fire, and twist and snort and make
up and try to go to sleep again. Dash it all, I must
look like a wreck! I feel like one, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Making an attempt to sit up, he dropped back with
a doleful groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jingoes, but that does pull on my neck!” he murmured,
holding his head canted to one side. “What
makes my neck so lame? I suppose I know. That
whelp Merriwell chucked me headlong against the wall
in the basement of that old warehouse. Wonder I
didn’t spill my brains all over that wall. Next thing I
knew I was getting scorched and everything around me
seemed on fire. That brought me to my senses in a
hurry, but when I tried to find the way out I was
so bewildered that I didn’t know what to do. How
did I get out, anyhow? Oh, yes, somebody came back
and grabbed me and dragged me toward the door.
Somebody—it was Merriwell! That’s right, by Jove,
it was Merriwell! The rest of the fellows were gone.
They had sneaked and left me, the cowards! They
left me to roast in that fire trap. That’s a fine bunch
of friends to have!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He finally succeeded in sitting up, holding both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>hands to his head as he groaned and cursed in mingled
pain and anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was just about the worst night I ever experienced.
And to think I might have roasted only for
Merriwell! Hang it all! I hate to know I owe him
anything. Do I owe him anything? Why, of course
not. Didn’t he chuck me against the wall and knock
me senseless? Gee! I wouldn’t like to tell anybody
that he did, but that’s what happened. I suppose some
of those sneaks who skipped and left me will tell. No,
they won’t. They don’t dare. They’ll keep their faces
closed. But Merriwell’s friends—those who were with
him—they’ll tell. Let ’em! let ’em! They don’t know
who it was rigged up in those devil togs. Anyhow,
if they do suspect, they can’t prove it. I won’t acknowledge
it, you bet your sweet life!</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t owe Merriwell anything. If he’d left
me there, it would have been the same as murder.
After chucking me against the wall and sending my
wits wool-gathering, it was up to him to get me out.
I’m not going to blow up with gratitude toward him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch was greatly relieved over the thought that he
did not owe the lad he bitterly hated anything like
a debt of gratitude. This caused him to grin the least
bit, and, with some mumbling and muttering, he painfully
dragged himself out of bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose a hot bath would do me good,” he said,
“but I’m too stiff to get into a tub. I don’t know when
I ever felt this way before. Toleman was the only
one who had decency enough to come around last
night to find out whether I was alive or had been
cooked in that fire. I suppose he told the rest of the
bunch that I was here, all right. Confound it! what
brought Merriwell and his gang out there to the warehouse?
That fellow always turns up and spoils things.
How did he know we had Tucker there? He seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>get onto every move we make lately. Somebody is
giving us away. It can’t be Wolfe, for he wouldn’t
dare, and I know it isn’t Ditson or Toleman. I can
trust Poland, too. But Daggett—that fellow would do
anything for money. If the Merriwell gang tried it,
they could buy him easy enough. Still, he seems the
fiercest against Dick Merriwell. I don’t trust him.
We’ve got to cut him out somehow. It’s pretty hard
work doing it now he knows so much, but it’s necessary
to find a way. We had to cut Lee out. Only
yesterday I gave Wolfe a call-down for telling Lee
about our plans. The kid hasn’t any backbone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After washing up, Mike began to dress with more
or less difficulty. At intervals he paused to touch
gently the lump on his head. Every time he did this
he growled.</p>

<p class='c007'>His head still throbbed, and when he stooped over
to lace his shoes something like a sledge hammer
seemed pounding within it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, ache! ache!” he rasped. “You’ll get over it
pretty soon—you’ll have to. I’m glad I haven’t any
marks on my face, and I won’t wear a bandage round
my head. My hat will cover that bump. They can’t
spot me. I’ll have to get rid of that devil rig, though.
Found my overcoat where we left our clothes when
we dressed back of the old warehouse. Only for that
I’d never been able to get to this room without being
pinched. Lucky my overcoat was good and long and
hid my costume. Two fellows did stop to stare at
my red ankles, but I took to my heels, and I know
they didn’t recognize me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Opening his wardrobe door, he found the crimson
masquerade suit, which he made into a bundle carefully
wrapped in brown paper and securely tied with
stout cord. This bundle was hidden away beneath
some underclothing in a drawer of the dresser.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I’ll dispose of that to-night,” he muttered. “Don’t
like to have stolen property on my premises. It was
Ditson’s idea to rig up in those costumes. He thought
it would frighten Tucker. Hanged if it didn’t seem to
amuse the little fool! I’m going to quit taking the
foolish advice of Ditson or anybody else. I didn’t
see anything like a joke in that business. I was in
earnest. But now I suppose we wasted our time. Of
course this isn’t any good at all, and I may as well
destroy it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From a pocket he produced the typewritten confession
which Tucker had been forced to sign.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it’s no good now,” he muttered, after reading
it over. “The little rat could prove he was compelled
to sign against his will. If any one tried to use this
document, it would get him into a nasty scrape. This
will settle it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In front of the fireplace he struck a match and applied
the flame to one corner of the paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing?” cried a voice that made him
jump as if struck by a bolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The burning paper fluttered to the hearth, and Lynch
turned a pale face toward the lad who had softly
opened the door and thrust his head into the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee!” he breathed, with mingled relief and resentment.
“You gave me a jerk. What the dickens do
you mean by poking your head into my room and
yelling like that? Come in and shut that door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bern Wolfe needed no invitation. Slamming the
door behind him, he leaped toward the hearth and
placed his foot on the burning paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get away! get away!” said Lynch, catching the
visitor by the collar, and jerking him back. “Let it
burn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Tucker’s confession!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Are you crazy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had trouble enough getting that confession.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too much trouble,” confessed Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now it’s destroyed!” groaned Bern, as he
watched the flames char the sheet and turn it to a black
film of ash, which crinkled at a breath and dissolved
into fluttering fragments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t any use after what happened,” declared
Lynch. And he proceeded to explain his reason for
thinking so. “You see,” he concluded, “that thing
might have gotten me into trouble if I had kept it
and any one had chanced to find it in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose that’s right,” muttered Bern, his thin lips
pulled back from the points of his sharp white teeth.
“Yes, I see you’re right, Mike, but I swear I’d like
to get some sort of a twist on that fellow Tucker. He’s
playing the position on the nine that I ought to fill.
I’m a better shortstop than Tucker ever was or ever
will be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you are,” nodded Mike, “but you’re not
one of Richard Merriwell’s petsy-wetsies. Therefore
you have no show to play on the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s not the reason why I’m not playing on
the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? It isn’t?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what is the reason?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know well enough!” snapped Bern bitterly.
“You know I had my chance to get on the team, and
I landed there, too. Only for your great scheme to
knife Merriwell, I’d be playing on the team now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, hold on—hold on. Don’t always try to
shoulder everything onto me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m telling you the truth, and you know it!” cried
Wolfe, smashing his clenched right hand into his open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>left. “If I’d refused to listen to your scheme, I’d be
playing shortstop and Tucker would be on the bench.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah! bah! What are you giving us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah! bah! Bleat away. It’s a fact. Merriwell
was ready to use me. He did use me. I played in that
Hudson game until I got spiked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you haven’t played since,” grinned Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Merriwell and his friends are dead sure
that I was concerned in the giving away of Umpty-ten’s
signals. That was your plan to hurt Merriwell,
but it never harmed him a bit. Instead of that, it
swamped me, all right, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What right has Merriwell to keep you off the
team? There’s never been anything proven against
you, has there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not proven perhaps, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you’re not being used right, Bern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not proven, but established as a conviction in Merriwell’s
mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rot! rot! You just think it has been established
as a conviction in his mind. You don’t know whether
it has or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do know he is satisfied that Tucker is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Tucker, being one of his goo-goo boys, gets
the chance to play, while you pine on the bench.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell knows I’m friendly with you. He
knows you would do anything in this world to hurt
him. He doesn’t trust me. If I’d cut loose from you
the way Kates did, I’d be on the team the same as
Kates is. He’s there, isn’t he? You can’t say Merriwell
is keeping one of his particular pets on first to
the exclusion of Kates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell had to have a first baseman and an assistant
pitcher. Ambitious as he is, as much as he
likes to show off, he can’t do all the pitching. Toleman
was sulking, and the team just had to accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Kates. That’s plain enough. You didn’t have a
chance of forcing yourself in the way Sam did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t tell me that! I don’t believe it. I got
there once. What have I made by listening to your
plans and plots? I’ve lost the chance I had, and even
though they can’t prove anything against me I’m under
suspicion. You’ve said you would clear me, but never
yet have you made a single promise good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, hold on!” snarled Lynch, his red hair seeming
to bristle. “That’s just about enough from you.
Haven’t I been doing my best? Wasn’t I putting myself
out on your account last night, and didn’t it come
near being my finish?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you that was a preposterous scheme before
we started in upon it. You were the only one in the
crowd who thought it would amount to anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know—I heard ’em say so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why did they take any part in it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For a lark. It was to have some amusement with
Tucker that those masquerade costumes were stolen
and worn. I was against that piece of business, but
Ditson had been drinking, and he was ready for any
piece of recklessness. Give him a couple of drinks,
and you never know what he’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’re about as ungrateful a runt as I ever
saw!” declared Lynch bitterly. “I wash my hands of
it. I’m through trying to help you. If you want to,
you can go tell every one that you gave away the
team’s signals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I’m not likely to do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what you’re likely to do. Why, I’ve
even convinced our own bunch that Tucker was the
guilty one instead of you. They believe it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They pretend to,” muttered Bern, “but I’m not
sure they do.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“To tell the truth, a fellow can’t be sure of much of
anything with them,” growled Mike. “Look at the
way they skipped me last night! Wasn’t that fine?
You did the same thing. You dusted out with the rest
and left me to the mercies of the Merriwell bunch, or
to roast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was every man for himself then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, was it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And in such a case you’d leave a friend lying unconscious
to be burned to death, would you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know you were unconscious. I was having
troubles enough of my own. I didn’t know what happened
to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll tell you what happened. About four of
those fellows, including Merriwell himself, jumped on
me in a bunch. One of them hit me over the head
with a piece of lead pipe or something like that. That
was the last I knew until I found myself lying on the
floor, almost choked by smoke and nearly roasted by
fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was a tough situation,” admitted Wolfe.
“How’d you get out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did I? I wish you’d tell me. I crawled
among those boxes and bales on all fours without having
an idea where the door was. Just by good luck
I found it. Only for that good luck, my bones would
be lying this minute in the ruins of Dinsmore &amp;
Hyde’s old warehouse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a mighty bad piece of business,” breathed
Bern, shaking his head. “Only for that accidental
fire the Merriwell crowd would have had us all pinched.
I can see what would have happened to us. The fire
gave us a chance to break away, for they had to take
care of themselves, and they were all afraid of being
nabbed by the police or some one. You see you can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>blame me for leaving you, Mike. I didn’t know what
had happened to you, and I don’t think the others
did. It was pretty rank of the Merriwell bunch when
they skipped out and left you there. Seems to me it
was up to some of them to look after you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, they didn’t,” lied Mike. “But why didn’t
some of you fellows come around last night to find
out whether I reached my room or not? Toleman was
the only chap who had decency enough to poke his
nose in here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We sent him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. He came back and reported you were here.
We didn’t think it best to come around in a bunch just
then. I’m the first one to show up this morning, ain’t
I? Well, doesn’t that indicate that I take some interest?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” mocked Mike, as he buttoned his collar
and began knotting his necktie. “I expect you were
so terribly disturbed over me that you didn’t sleep a
wink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I didn’t sleep much,” confessed Wolfe. “I
haven’t been doing much sleeping for the past two or
three weeks. I’m getting thin, and I feel like a leftover
jag the most of the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t tell me how you feel. I’ve got a bump as
big as a lemon here on my coconut. My head aches.
My neck is stiff. My back is lame, and every breath I
exhale smells of smoke. All on your account, too.
And you come around here and growl! You make me
sick. Get out of my way! Sit down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch thrust his companion on a chair just as the
door opened and other visitors appeared.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Duncan Ditson was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, you here, Wolfe?” he said. “We wondered
where you were.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Toleman stalked in behind Dunc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reported last night, Lynch,” he said. “Let them
know you were still on earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that soothed our disturbed spirits a great
deal,” said Jim Poland, finding a chair and gracefully
seating himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Sst!” hissed Mel Daggett, who was the last to
enter. “Don’t you know the door’s open? Don’t talk
so loud, you fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Softly and silently closing and latching the door,
Mel waddled to the morris chair and squatted on the
broad arm of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch, hands resting on hips, squared himself in
front of Daggett.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you’d tell me something, Mel,” he said, with
an air of unmistakable accusation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will if I can,” whispered Mel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did the Merriwell bunch know where to find
us last night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Daggett’s froglike mug took on an expression of
puzzled blankness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s something I’d like to know,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t I know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the question I put to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mel caught his breath with a hissing sound, glared
at Mike with his green eyes, and then slowly rose to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“Now, see here,” he snapped, shaking one of his
knobby fists at Lynch, “if you mean to insinuate anything
about me, you’d better go slow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw, sit down,” said Mike, placing his fingers
against Mel’s breast and pushing him back upon the
chair. “Don’t do that with me, Daggett. Don’t lift
your fist to me; you’re liable to get hit if you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you hit me, you’ll be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’ll you do, peach on the crowd?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t stand for that—I won’t stand for it!” palpitated
Daggett.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re not standing for it—you’re sitting. Somebody
gave away our plans to carry Tucker off to that
old warehouse last night. Who did it? Who
peached?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you come at me like this? Am I the only
one who knew about your plan? Didn’t the others
know? Why don’t you make your talk to them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I know Ditson, Poland, Toleman, or
Wolfe would not breathe a word of it. I don’t know
about you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mel squirmed and tried to rise again, but was once
more pushed back by Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t get up,” said Lynch. “I’ve asked you a
question.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’ve given you all the answer you’ll get from
me!” snarled Daggett. “I didn’t peach on anybody.
You’ve never seen me trying to get in with the Merriwell
crowd. You can’t say as much about some of
the rest of your friends. I’m not calling any names,
but you know who I mean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you mean me,” said Wolfe. “Perhaps you
think I’m the one who gave it away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t say so. I’m not accusing anybody. Lynch
is making all that sort of talk that’s being made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I mean to find out how it happens that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Merriwell gets wind of everything we plan to do. Of
course, if you say you didn’t let anything slip, we’ll
have to take your word for it, Daggett.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You needn’t take my word for it if you don’t want
to. But if you continue to insinuate, I’ll fight you as
sure as I live. Perhaps you can do me up, but we’ll
see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly believe Dag would go back on us, Mike,”
said Poland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not,” put in Toleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anyhow,” said Ditson, “we can’t afford to suspect
a fellow unless there are proofs against him. Have
you any evidence—any reason to believe Mel squealed
on us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No reason beyond the fact that some one must
have squealed, and I feel confident the rest of the
crowd wouldn’t do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is not the first time you and I have had words,
Lynch,” said Daggett. “I want you to understand
that I’m just as trustworthy as you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re a greedy hog. A fellow who asks
friends twenty per cent a month on money loaned to
them would do almost anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s business, that’s business!” snapped Mel.
“There’s nothing underhand or sneaky about it. If
they borrow, they know what they’re expected to pay.
If you mean to insinuate that I would sell my friends
out to the Merriwell crowd, let me tell you that you’re
a confounded liar. Is that good enough for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that Lynch would make a lunge for Daggett’s
throat, but both Ditson and Toleman interfered
and checked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Steady, Mike,” said Dunc. “We can’t afford to
have a fuss just now. The very fact that Mel is so
indignant over your suspicions ought to satisfy you
of his innocence. I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Of course it was queer that Merriwell got onto the
business the way he did,” admitted Toleman; “but I
am not willing to think that any one of the fellows
here turned traitor. It leaked out through some accident
and not through deliberate treachery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be right,” admitted Mike, calming down.
“I’m in a rotten bad humor this morning. I ought
to be after what happened last night. I’ve just been
telling Wolfe what I thought of you fellows for quitting
me the way you did. Somebody must have seen
me knocked out by the Merriwell crowd, yet you all
skidooed like a lot of frightened rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One and all, they protested that they had not realized
he was knocked out. Apparently none of them
had seen Merriwell fling him against the wall, at the
foot of which he fell stunned and helpless. Satisfied
that this was the case, Mike once more repeated his
statement that he had been attacked by at least four
of the Merriwell crowd and had been knocked senseless
by a blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was having it with Merriwell himself when the
others jumped on me,” he said. “If they’d only let
me alone about ten seconds more, I’d broken that fellow’s
back for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” nodded Ditson doubtfully; “but he has
a very tough back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you fellows read the papers this morning?”
inquired Poland. “I have. The police say the old
warehouse was burned by firebugs. We want to keep
mum, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was not all I read in the paper,” came from
Toleman. “Didn’t you notice the account of the
burglarizing of Steigler’s costuming shop? I want
you to know that I’ve disposed of the outfit I wore
last night. You can’t find it anywhere around my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>joint. The rest of you chaps better get rid of your
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t be so timid!” mocked Ditson. “Who’ll
ever suspect us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait! What if some of the Merriwell crowd were
seen and recognized? What if they’re cornered and
tell all they know? What if they take a notion to tell,
anyhow? Although they can’t prove it against us,
I’ll venture to say they know every one of us. Now,
if the police get next to them and ask them questions,
won’t they name us chaps as being responsible for
that fire? If we’re named, you can bank on it that
the cops will search our rooms for some of the rigs
we wore. I’d a hundred times rather be pinched for
the fire than the other job. We could swear that the
fire was the result of an accident, a lark; and, although
we might regard the other business as a lark,
the police would not look on it in that light, and the
court would be sure to inflict punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s right,” nodded Lynch. “I’m going to dispose
of my outfit just as soon as I can, and the rest of you
better do the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you’re all so frightened now,” sneered
Ditson, “that there isn’t one who’ll dare lift his hand
against Merriwell during the rest of the term.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the use?” grunted Toleman. “Never anything
works right. Fellows, Merriwell is too much for
us. He has too much luck or too much something.
We’ll never do him any harm by striking at him direct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be right about that, Bill,” acknowledged
Lynch. “I’ve begun to think so myself. It’s queer
how some chaps seem to have a guardian angel, or a
genius, or something that always takes care of them.
All winter we’ve been saying Merriwell wouldn’t make
much of a reputation at baseball with the kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>team he’d have behind him this spring. Now he’s attracting
any amount of attention. Why, Billings—the
great Billings—has written it that Merriwell might
coach the pitchers of the varsity. Think of that—a
freshman coach for the varsity pitchers! But no one
seems to realize the fact that Merriwell himself would
be rotten if he didn’t have a catcher behind the bat
who knows him and all his peculiarities. Only for
Buckhart, Merriwell wouldn’t be such a star on the
slab. Where’s there another freshman who could go
behind the bat and handle Merriwell’s pitching?
Where’s there another chap who could handle the combination
ball or any of Merriwell’s queer kinks and
shoots? Of course, a professional catcher, a big-league
man, would be all right for it; but I’m talking
about the freshman ball players to be found at Yale
to-day. Don’t think I’m in love with Buckhart—he’s
the fellow I dislike most next to Merriwell himself.
I’m simply stating the truth. Without Buckhart, Merriwell
would be an ordinary dub of a pitcher that any
one could hit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think there’s something in that, Mike,” nodded
Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think so, too,” said Toleman promptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, can’t you see what I’m driving at?” inquired
Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take Buckhart away from the team, and what will
happen to Merriwell? He’ll get his bumps, won’t he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very likely,” nodded Duncan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure he will,” persisted Mike. “If he tries to use
those effective balls of his, the catcher will fumble
them. There’ll be passed balls galore. Every man
on the field faces the catcher. Let the catcher go to
pieces, and it’s up in a balloon for the rest of the bunch.
Now, look here, Umpty-ten Yale plays Umpty-ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Brown at Providence next Saturday. Those Brown
fellows can bat. If anything should happen to Brad
Buckhart to prevent him from catching in that game,
Brown would have a cinch. I know of lots of Yale
money that is just begging for a chance to back
Umpty-ten. Fix it so Merriwell will lose his catcher,
and we fellows can line our pockets just as sure as
fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are you going to fix it?” inquired Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” grinned Mike, “if this crowd hasn’t got
brains enough to devise a scheme, it’s a mighty poor
bunch. Let’s put our heads together and do a little
plotting.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick gave up trying to grind. It was mid-afternoon
and once more his friends who roomed in the
house had wandered in upon him and were chattering
away regardless of his desire to study.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had been speaking of disguises and practical
jokes. Bigelow was telling them what a fine Irishman
Dick became when he wished to represent one
and had the necessary make-up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t he fool the cops that night you took in the
cock fight, Tucker?” demanded Big. “Didn’t he fool
you, too? You know he did. Both you and Jones
were scared out of your senses when you got back
here. Said you’d been recognized and your names
called by a policeman. Felt sure that meant the end
of Yale for both of you. Oh, but you were scared!
Tommy was white round the gills, and all Blessed
could do was groan and quote fake scripture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Verily I was exceedingly distressed,” acknowledged
Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I confess I was scared blue,” said Tucker.
“But out in that old barn with only two or three lanterns
to illuminate the place it was easy enough for
anybody to fool us. I’m not saying Dick isn’t good
at making up and playing a part, but he never could
deceive a native of old Erin if he tried to represent an
Irishman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bet he could, bet he could!” spluttered Bouncer.
“Couldn’t you, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” confessed Dick, “but I have an idea
that I might succeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m willing to bet ten you can’t fool any real Irishman,”
cried Tucker.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“I won’t bet, you know,” laughed Dick, “but I don’t
mind trying it. Tell you what I’ll do—I’ll experiment
on Maggie Swazey. She’s a good subject, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>They agreed that Maggie, the maid of all work in the
rooming house, was acceptable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are you going to experiment on her, partner?”
questioned Buckhart.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a moment’s thought Dick unfolded his plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know where to get a policeman’s uniform that
will fit me unless those fellows who robbed Steiger’s
place got away with the outfit. I’ll rig up as an Irish
cop this evening, and I’ll stroll around here and call on
Maggie shortly after eight o’clock. Tell you what I’ll
do, fellows—I’ll make love to Maggie. That ought to
be a satisfactory test. If I can fool her to that extent,
I ought to be able to fool any one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly thou art taking thy life in thy lily-white
hands,” said Blessed. “If Maggie ever tumbles to
the trick, she’ll split your skull.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, say, that ought to be a circus!” shouted Tucker
hilariously. “I’d give anything if I could see the
sport.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t you find a way to see it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to be in it, too,” grinned Bigelow. “Oh,
I wouldn’t want to miss that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss it?” said Buckhart. “You bet your boots I
don’t propose to miss it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’ll you do?” asked Tommy and Bouncer in a
breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the pantry for mine!” announced the Texan.
“I’ll ensconce myself in the pantry where I can take
in the doings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maggie has an old couch down there that she rests
on when she’s very tired,” grinned Tucker. “I speak
for a snug berth beneath that couch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where can I conceal my slight and sylphlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>form?” asked Bigelow. “Say, Buckhart, you ought
to let me have the pantry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then where would I fit in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sink,” cried Bigelow; “you can get under the
sink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw, no, that won’t do,” protested Brad. “Think
of me hiding under a sink! Great horn spoon!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re selfish,” declared Bouncer. “Yes, you
are selfish, Buckhart. I can’t get under the sink to
save my neck—you can. I could hide in the pantry
or the cold room. If you’re going to have the pantry,
I’ll take the cold room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll see more of the fun than either one of you,”
laughed Tucker. “Next to my chosen retreat beneath
the couch, I’d choose the sink, for then I could keep the
door open on a crack and watch everything that was
going on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This don’t seem to be a time for dignity,” said
Brad, “so I’ll take the sink for mine. But, however
are we going to get to our retreats, gents?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got sort of left me out,” observed Jones. “I
suppose you think I don’t enjoy life, anyhow, and
there’s no use in trying to amuse me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell you what you can do,” cried Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s kind, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can help us out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Maggie ever catches you stowed around the
kitchen, she’ll help you out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can call her upstairs for something, Jonesy,
and give us a chance to sneak into the kitchen. Will
you do it? Sure you will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, certainly!” grunted Blessed. “That’s all I’m
good for. Work me, work me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you fellows want to be sure of seeing the sport,”
smiled Dick, “don’t fail to have yourselves properly
concealed in the kitchen by eight o’clock. I shall arrive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>within five or ten minutes after the hour. That’s
settled now. You chaps skidoo. Yes, I mean it. Your
room is preferable to your company for the next hour.
I’ve got to study.”</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the arrangement, Jones appeared at
the kitchen door some five minutes before eight that
evening, and requested Maggie Swazey to do him a
little favor. He was studying hard, he said, and
couldn’t spare the time to run out to the nearest stationery
store for a couple of notebooks. Would she
mind getting them for him?</p>

<p class='c007'>The sight of a silver quarter in the way of emolument
for her services quickly banished any sign of
hesitation on Maggie’s part.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, sir—certainly I’ll git ye the books,”
she smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what I want,” said Blessed. “If you
don’t, here’s a sample—here’s one of my old books.
You can take that along. When you come back bring
them up to my room, but get them right away—don’t
lose a minute. Time is precious with me this evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The moment the door closed behind Maggie three
chuckling lads scudded into the kitchen and prepared
to conceal themselves. At the last moment Buckhart
seemed inclined to rebel against hiding beneath the
sink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can sure get in there, Big,” he said. “Try
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bouncer dropped on all fours and quickly demonstrated
the impossibility of seeking to stow himself
away beneath the sink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a slick place, Brad,” he gurgled. “If I could
only get in there, I’d take it in a jiffy. You can
back in all right, and here’s a nice little knot hole
through which you can see everything that’s going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>on. Cricky, that knot hole must have been made on
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That certain is a right fine knot hole,” agreed the
Texan, with a grin. “Don’t know but I’ll make use
of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With more or less clattering and banging, he finally
succeeded in backing in amid the pots and pans and
settling himself in a comfortable position with the
knot hole convenient to his eye if he lifted his head a
bit. But even after getting in there he was again
struck by the thought that his position was most undignified,
and he started to crawl out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you don’t!” spluttered Bouncer, slamming the
sink door and turning the little wooden button that
held it. “You just keep still. It’s me to the pantry,
and I won’t have you spoiling my fun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wait till I do get out!” growled Buckhart’s
smothered voice. “I sure will spank you good and
plenty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurry up, Big!” hissed Tucker, thrusting his head
out from beneath the couch. “If you keep on puttering
around, Maggie will come back and catch you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy made a dash for the pantry. Five minutes
after the return of Maggie Swazey there came a
familiar tapping at one of the kitchen windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed the girl; “it must be
Dennis. I didn’t expect him to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She hastened to the door and opened it wide in a
welcoming manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good avenin’, Dennis,” she laughed. “How does
it happen you’re here so early?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not Dinnis Oi am,” announced a voice, as a
man wearing the uniform of an officer stepped into
the room. “Me name is Patrick McGee, and Oi’ve
been app’inted to the beat lately hild by me lamentid
fri’nd Dinnis Maloney.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Your lamented friend?” gasped Maggie. “Why,
what do you mean, sir? Oh, tell me, has anything
terrible happened to Dennis?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure and there has,” was the sad and solemn answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie seemed ready to faint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He isn’t dead, is he?” she almost shrieked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Worse thon thot,” answered the visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie stiffened up in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Worse than dead?” she gasped. “Why, how can
that be possible? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s married,” said the stranger, in a heart-broken
manner.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>And now Maggie did utter a shriek. After swaying
a moment, she fell limply into the arms of Patrick
McGee, who unhesitatingly supported her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a queer-looking, medium-sized man with a
face which, using the hackneyed phrase, “looked like
a map of Ireland.” He had bushy eyebrows, a fringe
of chin whiskers, sand hair, and a plentiful spattering
of freckles. On finding himself clasping the limp
form of Maggie, Patrick twisted his mug into a comical
expression of dismay so that Tommy Tucker,
eagerly peering forth from beneath the couch, was
forced to stuff his handkerchief into his mouth to hold
back a shout of laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Howld on, howld on, mavourneen!” spluttered Pat.
“Don’t yez be afther floppin’ over loike this, me darlint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Married?” choked Maggie, in the greatest anguish.
“Oh, it can’t be true!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Av it ain’t true, Oi’m a liar!” said McGee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did this happen?” asked the girl, attempting
to brace up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This marnin’,” was the answer. “Yer see she
caught him, and he had to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She caught him? Who caught him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wan of his girruls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One—one of his girls?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yis, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of them? How many did he have?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear, Oi don’t think he really knew himsilf.
Wan toime he towld me he was shpooning around
some sexteen or seventeen girruls.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Maggie popped up straight and stiff as a ramrod,
flinging the visitor’s supporting arms aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sixteen or seventeen girls?” she cried furiously.
“Impossible! I can’t believe that! You are deceiving
me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With his hand to his chin and his head canted sidewise,
Patrick McGee gave her a look of injured reproof.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Desaving ye, me darlint?” he said. “I wouldn’t
do that for the worruld!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now hold on right where you are,” commanded
Miss Swazey. “Don’t you dare to ‘darlint’ me. Why,
you scoundrel—to think of you coming around here
with such terrible inflammation and then calling me
darlint! And you tried to hug me—you know you
did! There’s the door, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A foine door it is,” said Patrick, as he closed it.
“Exchuse me av Oi forgot to shut it behoind me.
Now phwats the use av gittin’ dishturbed loike this
over a little thing, Maggie, dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maggie, dear; Maggie, dear? How do you know
my name is Maggie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Phwoy, me fri’nd Dinnis towld me, av course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your friend! your friend! So you shamelessly
confess you’re the friend of that deceiving monster!
Oh, I wish I had him here. I wouldn’t do a thing to
him! I’d scratch his eyes out! I’d pull his carroty
hair out by the roots! The monster! Deceiving a
poor trusting girl like me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush now,” protested McGee. “Don’t be too
harrud on Dinnis, the poor bhoy. He couldn’t hilp
it, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Couldn’t help it? Couldn’t help having sixteen or
seventeen girls at the same time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But ye see he was such a fascinating divvil,” whispered
Pat, with a grin and a wink. “The girruls, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>darlints, wouldn’t let him alone at all, at all. But it
nearly broke poor Dinnis’ heart whin Katie nabbed
him and led him to the praste. She meant business,
and there was nivver a bit av a chance for him to
escape. Whin it was all over he says to me, says he:
‘Pathrick, I lave it to yez to break the news to me
Maggie. It’s me Maggie Oi loved most of all other
girruls in all the worruld. It’s me Maggie Oi meant
to marry. Tell her, the swate crather, that me heart
do be breaking. Oi’ll nivver see her again. Oi’m
done wid me job, and ye’ve got it, Pathrick. Oi’m
going to lave this city and go far away to some foreign
country. Oi think Oi shall go to New Jersey.’ Then
the poor bhoy broke down and placed his head on me
breast and sprinkled me bosom wid his tears. Exchuse
me, Miss Swazey, but Oi have to wipe me eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only did he wipe his eyes but he blew such a
bugle blast with his nose that Maggie was actually
frightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something like a smothered snicker seemed to come
from some part of the room, but Patrick coughed
loudly and Maggie failed to detect the suspicious sound.
Miss Swazey was affected in spite of herself. She
began to choke and sob into her apron, which she now
held before her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dennis was a fine gent,” she said. “He used to
bring me candy and peanuts, and sometimes he brought
me banannies and other fruit. I don’t know what I
will do without Dennis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this Patrick placed his hand over his heart and
lay his head sidewise upon his own shoulder, while a
sickly languishing light filled his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Av ye’ll not take it amiss, Miss Swazey,” he murmured,
“you nade nivver go wanting for candy and
peanuts and banannies as long as Pathrick McGee remains
on this bate. Av course Oi know Oi’m not such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>a handsome mon as Dinnis, but Oi’ve got a heart in
me bosom, Oi have. Besoides thot, not being handsome,
there’s no danger thot Oi’ll have sixteen or
seventeen other girruls. Oi’m ready to do me bist to
take the place of Dinnis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but I’ll never trust another man—never!
never!” moaned Maggie. “They’re all deceivers, every
one of them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oi wouldn’t desave yez for the worruld,” assured
the visitor earnestly. “Just give me one trial, Maggie,
me darlint. It’s awful lonesome ye’ll be now without
Dinnis to come round and tap at yer windy. Ye’ll be
afther broodin’ over yer throubles, and maybe ye’ll
pine away and doie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope I do!” sighed Maggie. “I’d like a quiet
resting spot in the cold, cold ground. If I die, perhaps
Dennis would come to my grave some time and
place a flower upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or a bananny,” said Patrick. “But yez couldn’t
ate a bananny then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Dennis could only see me in my coffin, I know
he’d have remorse. I know—boo, hoo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie broke down completely, and the visitor made
bold to slip an arm around her waist again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye poor choild!” he murmured, leading her toward
the couch. “Do be afther sitting down, me dear. Oi’ll
sit besoide yez. Rist yer head on me shoulder. There,
there, don’t cry loike thot! It’ll make yer nose red.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment Tommy Tucker who had discovered
one of Maggie’s hatpins beneath the couch proceeded
to jab the instrument up between the springs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow! wow!” howled Patrick McGee, making an
electrified spring into the air. “Bumblebees and hornets!
phwat were thot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>With one hand he industriously rubbed the spot that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>had been reached by the hatpin. At the same time, he
danced round the room in the most grotesque manner
imaginable. Maggie lowered her apron and stared
at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with you?” she asked. “Have
you gone crazy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s just a bit of neuraligy,” spluttered Patrick.
“Did yez iver have it, Maggie? It’s worse thon the
jumpin’ toothache. Whin it gives me a twinge loike
thot Oi am liable to yell the top av me head off, so
I am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While making this explanation he walked back to
the couch and kicked beneath it in the vain hope of
hitting the mischievous rascal concealed there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do sit down again,” urged Maggie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oi don’t dare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oi fear Oi’d have another attack of the neuraligy.
Shtand up, me darlint—sthand up and look into me
eyes. You remind me av Kate Kearney. Did ye iver
hear of Kate Kearney?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, did yez not hear of Kate Kearney?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She lives on the banks of Killarney;</div>
      <div class='line'>From the glance av her eye shun danger and fly,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For fatal’s the glance of Kate Kearney.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re a perfectly lovely singer!” exclaimed
Maggie, rising with clasped hands. “You have the
most beautiful voice!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indade Oi have,” agreed Pat. “Unfortunately
thot’s the ownly thing beautiful about me. Oi can
sing loike a birrud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment there was a slight rattling amid the
pans beneath the sink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goodness me, there’s that rat again!” cried Maggie.
“I’ll set the trap for that rat this very night.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Oi hope ye catch him,” said Pat. “Oi wish ye’d
be after telling me whether me voice is tenor eleven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O the days of the Kerry dancing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O the ring of the poiper’s tune!</div>
      <div class='line'>O for one of those hours av gladness,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Gone, alas! like our youth, too soon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Lovely! lovely! lovely!” gushed Maggie. “A man
who can sing like that must have a beautiful disposition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oi have,” assured McGee. “Av Oi iver git married,
Oi’ll trate me wife roight. Av she cooks me
meals, washes the dishes, split the wood, brings in
the coal, takes in washing, and kapes the household
running dacently, Oi’ll nivver hit her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment there came a sudden crash from the
cold closet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good heavens!” cried Maggie. “What’s happened
now? Has the old cat got in there again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She sprang to the door and flung it open. Out
rolled Bouncer Bigelow covered from head to heels
with buttermilk, a panful of which he had upset and
brought down upon his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Land of wonders!” gurgled Maggie, aghast.
“What was you doin’ in there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was just looking for something to eat,” spluttered
Bouncer feebly. “I was starving to death, Maggie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Officer McGee promptly pounced on Bigelow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye spallpane!” he cried. “Ye thafe of the
worruld, it’s a burglar ye are! Oi place ye under arrist.
Not a worrud, ye villain! Oi’ll take yez to the station
house. Ye can talk to the sargint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bigelow appealed to Maggie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you let him pinch me,” said he, “I’ll tell Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Watson what’s going on here in her kitchen night
after night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie grasped Patrick by the arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s nothing, only one of the stujents that rooms
in the house,” she explained. “Do let him go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>McGee looked doubtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The scoundrel has been listenin’ to phwat we’ve
been sayin’, me darlint. He’ll be afther tillin’ on us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bigelow pretended that he was very much alarmed.
In Bouncer’s ear the pseudo officer whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Big. It’s time I got out of this. I think
I’ve made good, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But as he was dragging the fat boy toward the door
that door suddenly opened and in it appeared Officer
Dennis Maloney himself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 id='XXIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>SOMETHING DOING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stung!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Officer Maloney wore an expression of puzzled astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Phwat’s going on here, Oi dunno?” he inquired,
fixing a jealous eye on Patrick McGee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie Swazey seemed flabbergasted for a moment,
but she quickly recovered, and, pointing an accusing
finger at the new arrival, she shrieked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How dare you show your face here, you wretch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey?” grunted Maloney, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You scoundrel! You reprobate! You base deceiver!
You breaker of innocent hearts! You—you—you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She could find no epithet that expressed her intense
emotion. Behind the excited girl’s back Tommy
Tucker thrust his head out from beneath the couch and
cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hit the high places, Dick! Hump yourself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beneath the sink there was a crash as Buckhart inadvertently
brought down one of the tin pans. Bouncer
Bigelow was fruitlessly trying to mop some of the buttermilk
off his clothes with his handkerchief. It was
an interesting tableau, and, in spite of himself, the
disguised boy laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Phwat do ye mane by laughing?” roared Officer
Maloney. “Phwat’s your name? How did yez happen
to come on my bate? Ye shnake, ye’re trying to
steal me girrul!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hot blood mounted to the face of the speaker,
and he stepped belligerently into the room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Skip, Dick!” said Tucker, once more. “It’s your
last chance!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out!” cried Maggie, waving Maloney back. “I
don’t want to see your treacherous features. Don’t
show your face to me! You’ve broke my poor heart!
you’re a monster! Go back to your wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me woife?” shouted Dennis, astounded. “Go back
to phwat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back to your wife, you monster! Had seventeen
girls on the string at once, did you? Bragged about
it, did you? If I’d ever found that out in time, I’d
served you the way the other one did: I’d married
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, darlint, Oi don’t undershtand yes,” faltered
Maloney. “It’s not married Oi am at all, at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not—not married?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yit, and Oi nivver will be onless ye have me
yersilf.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but—but your friend—your friend, Officer
McGee—he told me you were married this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Maloney glared at the disguised boy, at the same
time reaching for his club.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me fri’nd, Officer McGee?” he rasped. “So thot’s
phwat he’s been telling ye, is it? Well, now Oi think
Oi’ll hav a bit to say to Officer McGee, a mon phwat
Oi nivver saw before in all me loife. Ye lyin’ shnake!
Oi’m goin’ to break yer head, so Oi am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He meant it, too, for he charged at Dick, who barely
escaped with a nimble duck and a quick dodge to one
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on, hold on!” spluttered Bigelow, managing
to get in the enraged policeman’s way. “Let’s have
an understanding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An ondershtandin’?” howled Maloney. “Oi’ll give
him an ondershtandin’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tucker started to crawl from beneath the couch, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the enraged Irishman hurled Bigelow staggering to
one side, and, getting his feet tangled, the fat boy
spun like a top and finished by sitting down heavily
on Tucker’s head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thump! thump! thump! It was Buckhart pounding
furiously on the sink door in an effort to get out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yow! yow!” squawked Tucker smotheredly; “my
nose—you’ve smashed my nose!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having clung fast to the hatpin, he now jabbed it
fiercely into Bigelow, who gave a wild yell of pain
and rolled out into the middle of the room just in time
to catch Officer Maloney’s foot and send him sprawling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven sakes!” palpitated Maggie Swazey, with
uplifted hands. “This is terrible!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick saw his opportunity now and embraced it. He
did not wait for Maloney to rise, but promptly ducked
for the back door and disappeared into outer darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h2 id='XXV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>REFUGE IN THE RIVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Although he did not fully understand the rather
surprising affair, Policeman Dennis Maloney was now
satisfied that his sweetheart, Maggie Swazey, had been
outrageously imposed upon by the scrubby-bearded,
red-faced, blue-coated, brass-buttoned individual he
had accidentally discovered there in the kitchen. What
part the three boys had taken in the affair he could not
understand. In fact, he was decidedly bewildered and
vexed, but, at the same time, his fighting blood was
aroused and he vowed terrible vengeance on Patrick
McGee if he could but once get his hands on that deceiving
scoundrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a furious imprecation, Maloney gave Bigelow
a fierce kick in the ribs, which brought another howl
of pain from the lips of the fat chap. Scrambling to
his feet, the policeman dashed toward the door unmindful
of the imploring shriek which came from
Maggie’s lips. Forth into the darkness he hustled in
pursuit of the disguised and fleeing lad, swearing the
most terrible vengeance as he vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scuttling along the alley, Dick paused to peer out
upon the street. He did not fancy Maloney would
pursue him closely, and therefore he was startled by
the sound of thudding feet and turned to see the dark
figure of the policeman charging upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cæsar’s ghost!” gasped the boy. “Here’s where
I take Tucker’s advice and hit the high places.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew it would be a serious thing for him if he
fell into the hands of the enraged officer. Confident
of his ability to outrun Maloney, he laughingly skipped
away. Behind him the policeman raised a great shouting.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Stop thafe! stop thafe!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking back, Merriwell saw the bluecoat, club in
hand, covering ground with wonderful speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy dodged to the right at the first corner. He
collided with another policeman who had heard Maloney’s
shouts, and was rushing to discover the meaning
of the uproar. Down they went.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in blazes——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick stopped the policeman by savagely interrupting:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean by interfering with me? Why
didn’t you nab that thief?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What thief?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The one who just dodged round this corner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t see any one,” said the surprised officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you were asleep!” snorted Merriwell, scrambling
up just as Maloney came panting and shouting
round the corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop thafe! stop thafe!” howled Dennis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop thief! stop thief!” shouted Dick, taking up
the cry and leading Maloney by barely a few yards in
the breathless rush down the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Into the very heart of town they raced, and the
crowds upon the lighted street scattered to give them
room. People stared in wonderment, seeking to catch
a glimpse of the fleeing thief whom those two policemen
seemed pursuing. A crowd of men and boys fell
in behind Maloney, joining in the cry of, “Stop thief!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is, the spallpane!” panted Dennis, pointing
at Dick, who was gradually increasing the distance
between them. “Shtop him! shtop him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But no one fancied that he meant the blue-coated
person who seemed to be leading this wild and desperate
pursuit of the unseen thief. Pointing ahead,
Dick took up the cry of the Irish cop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is! there he is! Stop him! stop him!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>At the very first opportunity Merriwell made haste
to escape from the more-crowded and better-lighted
streets. Round first one corner and then another he
whisked. Behind him came the hounds in full cry,
led by the persistent Irishman, who seemed entirely oblivious
to the fact that already he was far off his beat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Evidently Maloney will follow me as long as
there’s the slightest chance of overtaking me,” decided
Dick. “I’ve got to shake him and that mob.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, not until the vicinity of the Quinnepiac
was reached did the boy feel that he had succeeded
in his purpose. Resting beside the river a short distance
above the drawbridge, Merriwell chuckled over
his adventure.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not remain long undisturbed. Through the
darkness two skulking figures moved toward him, and,
fancying they were pursuers searching for him there,
he hastily crouched beside a pile of timbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two figures paused a short distance away and
began speaking in low tones. Peering through the
gloom, the boy made out that each carried a bundle in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to chuck my outfit in right here,” said
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to burn mine,” whispered the other
hoarsely, “but I couldn’t find an opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, hello!” thought the hidden boy. “I fancy I
know those chaps. I wonder what it is they’re going
to chuck into the river. My curiosity is too much for
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he leaped out and was right upon them
before they became aware of his presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surrender, ye raskills!” he cried. “Don’t thry to
resist an officer av the law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With gasps of dismay, both dropped their bundles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and took to their heels, running as if their very lives
depended upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” laughed Dick, picking up the bundles.
“Now I’ll find out what you were so anxious to dispose
of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the lumber pile, he settled himself on
a stick of timber and began to open the bundles, both
of which had been tightly rolled and securely tied with
cords. The knots bothered Dick, and he felt in vain
through the pockets of his unusual clothing in search
of a knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I haven’t a knife,” he muttered. “Didn’t
think to put my own in a pocket of this suit. I’ll have
to untie those knots.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a long and tiresome task, but he finally succeeded
with one of the bundles which was untied and
spread out on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Clothing of some sort,” he decided, “but it’s too
dark to see just what it is. I need a match.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more he searched through his pockets, finally
discovering the brimstone end of a broken match.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This will have to do,” he said, as he carefully
struck the match on his trousers leg.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shading it with his hands, he threw the light upon
the clothing outspread before him. It was a masquerade
suit of crimson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah-ha!” muttered Dick. “I think I have seen this
rig before. I think it was worn by Satan the night
the old warehouse burned, and if I’m not greatly mistaken
I recognized the voice of Satan just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was startled by the sound of footsteps, and,
turning to glance over his shoulder, discovered three
dark figures rapidly coming down upon him. The
match was dropped.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the three figures had appeared between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>boy and a distant electric light. He saw it was a
policeman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cornered!” thought Dick. “Jingoes, if they catch
me with this rig, I’ll be in a bad scrape! I can’t deny
that I was at the warehouse, and it’ll look as if I was
concerned in robbing the costumer’s shop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Catching up the crimson suit and the bundle, he
sought an opening by which he could escape, but the
trio had spread out and were hemming him in so that
there seemed absolutely no chance to dodge them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Begobs, we have him now!” shouted an exultant
voice—the voice of Dennis Maloney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet!” cried the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Splash!—he flung himself into the cold Quinnepiac.
Freeing himself of the bundle and the crimson masquerade
suit, the boy struck out into the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on!” he challenged. “Follow me! Catch
me! I dare you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back here, ye spallpane!” roared Maloney,
pausing at the water’s edge and vainly shaking his club
at the dark head which bobbed like a cork on the surface
of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a minute—I don’t think,” was the answer.
“Why don’t you come in for me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll have to come ashore somewhere,” said another
one of the trio. “The current is carrying him
down toward the bridge. Keep watch of him. We’ll
nab him when he tries to get out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid they will,” thought the boy. “I’m still
in a nasty scrape. What’ll I do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he flung up his arms and uttered a painful
cry for help.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cramps! cramps!” he shouted, floundering and
splashing in the current which was sweeping him toward
the bridge. “Help! quick! Ah——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Down he went, the water seeming to cut short that
last gasping cry for assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The poor devil is drowning,” chattered one of the
officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone!” cried another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Oi nivver aven put the weight of me hand on
him,” muttered Maloney regretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dark current swept on into the black shadows,
beneath the bridge, but they watched in vain for the
fugitive to rise to the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone,” muttered Dennis. “Oi’ll howld no
grudge. May the saints rest his sowl.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='XXVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>WHAT HAPPENED TO BRAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The boys waited in Dick’s room for him to reappear.
They were confident he had escaped Maloney.
With tears of merriment streaming down his cheeks,
Tucker rehearsed every particular of the preposterously
amusing affair that had taken place in the kitchen.
Tommy’s version of it was sufficient to bring a ghastly
smile to the solemn face of Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, it was funny, wasn’t it?” sneered Bigelow.
“I ruined a good suit of clothes, and then Tucker stuck
a butcher knife into me about a foot and a half, and
that Irish policeman wiped his feet on me and broke
a couple of ribs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I want to know,” said Buckhart, “is who
fastened me under the sink. Had to brace and push
with all my strength in order to break that door open.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When Dick skipped and Maloney went after him,
howling like a madman,” laughed Tommy, “Maggie
promptly collapsed. About that time Mrs. Watson
came down on us, and I expect we’ll all get fired out
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do wish my pard would show up,” muttered Buckhart,
glancing at the clock. “It’s strange he doesn’t
come back. Been more than an hour and a half now.
If he doesn’t get in before eleven, I’m going out looking
for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The restlessness of the Texan finally led him to slip
downstairs, and, hearing the murmur of voices coming
from the kitchen, he tiptoed to the door and listened.
A few minutes later he came charging into the
room where the boys were gathered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great horn spoon!” he gasped, his face pale and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>his eyes betraying the greatest excitement. “That
Irish cop is in the kitchen this minute. Just heard
him telling Maggie how they chased Dick clean to the
river, and he tried to get away by swimming. Maloney
says he got cramps and went down. Maloney
said he sure was drowned. I don’t believe it, but I’m
going to find out what I can about it. Who’s with
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Seizing their hats, they followed the Texan; but on
the front steps they encountered Merriwell, who was
getting out his latchkey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, fellows,” said Dick coolly. “Where are you
bound in such a rush?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” breathed Brad, in relief, “this sure is some
satisfying, partner. Just heard you were last seen
hollering for help in the river. You’re supposed to be
drowned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” laughed Dick, “and I’m willing they
should continue to cherish that delusion. It was the
only way I could escape. I pretended to sink, but
when the current carried me under the bridge I clung
to a pier until I could swim ashore without being seen.
It was hard work reaching the costumer’s without attracting
undesirable attention in my dripping clothes,
but I finally got there and made a change for my own
garments. I’m here, and I guess I’m all right unless
I get cold from that ducking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his room he told them about the two chaps who
had brought bundles of clothing with the evident intention
of casting those bundles into the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the fellows was Ditson,” said Dick. “I
think the other was Lynch. Either Ditson or Lynch
wore that satanic masquerade outfit. Of course, I
have no proof against them, and they could give me
the laugh if I accused them; but those chaps were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>concerned in the game to amuse themselves at your
expense, Tucker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve thought so right along,” said Tommy.
“They’ll overstep themselves yet and get into a scrape
they can’t squirm out of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the exciting events of the evening, Merriwell
slept well that night and did not catch cold from
his ducking. Shortly before one o’clock the following
day Brad Buckhart came hurrying into Dick’s room
and found Merriwell on the point of going out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pard,” said the Texan, “I’m in a scrape. Just met
Mabel Ditson and Bab Midhurst. Mabel was feeling
rather blue and downcast. It seems that Rob Claxton
invited her to attend Professor Oblong’s lecture on
Japan and then found out he couldn’t get seats. I
thought I knew where I could get a couple of seats,
and it seemed to me a good chance to get ahead of our
friend, the Virginian, and so I asked her if she would
go with me. She said she sure would, and I’ve been
round to the scalpers’ after those seats. There isn’t
one to be had for love or money. Now what do you
think of that? She’s going to be a whole lot disgusted
when I tell her I fizzled the same as Claxton
did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s see, when is this lecture?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thursday evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Friday afternoon we leave for Providence.
It’s just as well you didn’t get seats, Brad. You’re
supposed to turn in at ten o’clock Thursday night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I could make it pretty near that,” said the
Texan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those lectures never last later than ten. I’d have a
cab take Mabel home, drop her, and have cabby land
me at this ranch in double-quick order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you ought to thank your luck that you’re not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>compelled to listen to that lecture. Don’t you hear
lectures enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen!” snorted Buckhart. “What’s the matter
with you, pard? You don’t suppose I was going to
that lecture with the idea of listening to it, do you? I
was going to take a girl—the girl—the only girl. I
was going to steal a lap on Claxton. I wouldn’t care
if the old lecture was about the Hottentots or the Zulus.
Partner, I’m going to get into that lecture if I have
to pay a ten-dollar premium on tickets. You hear
me warble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’d better forget it,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Texan did not forget it, and on Thursday
he triumphantly announced that he had secured tickets
by paying double price for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’d better consult Jones about staying out
after ten to-night,” advised Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brad consulted Blessed and was given permission to
attend the lecture on his pledge to lose no time about
getting to bed after it was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Going to do this thing up brown, partner,”
chuckled Buckhart, as he dressed that evening. “My
carriage will call for me at seven-thirty. If you happen
to see Claxy this evening, be good enough to find
a way to tell him that I’ve taken Miss Ditson to the
lecture. That sure ought to bump him some.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of his promise to seek the mattress as quickly
as possible after the lecture was over, Brad permitted
himself to be lured into the house by Mabel, who told
him that Barbara wished to see him. He did not stop
many minutes, but came out in high good spirits,
bounded down the steps, reached the waiting cab, flung
open the door, and jumped in.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sprang into the enfolding arms of some one who
was sitting inside the cab. Those arms, clasped about
his own, held him like bands of steel.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Whoop!” roared the Texan, in astonishment.
“Whatever does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Over his shoulder a voice said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lively with that stuff! Come on, quick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Brad perceived a dark figure in front of him
and suddenly a sickly, pungent odor assailed his nostrils.
A handkerchief saturated with chloroform was
held over his mouth and nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan put up a savage fight, but his efforts
were futile, and in the end he was overcome, sinking
helpless in the arms of the fellow who had clung to
him with such fierce tenacity through it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Brad revived he found himself in a basement
room, stretched upon a wretched cot, with a rough table
near at hand and a smoking lamp burning on the table.
It was some time before he could realize his situation.
Gradually he recalled what had happened, and, with a
groan, he started up from the couch. He was still
dressed in evening clothes, although his collar and
necktie had been torn away. There was a sensation of
nausea at the pit of his stomach and his head swam.
After a moment he was forced to sink back upon the
couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does it mean?” he muttered. “Where am
I, anyhow? How did I get here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no windows save a small, narrow transom
above the one heavy door of the room. He was
impressed with the belief that the room was sunken
deep beneath the ground and no sounds he made could
be heard outside. Nevertheless, finally summoning his
strength, he raised an outcry.</p>

<p class='c007'>When there was no answer he succeeded in dragging
himself to his feet, reeled across the cemented
floor, and tried to open the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>It refused to move before his efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“No use,” he muttered, stumbling back to the couch
and dropping upon it. “I’m bagged. I can’t understand
it, and I suppose I’ll have to wait until somebody
comes around to explain. If it’s a joke, it’s a
blamed poor one. You hear me gurgle!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 id='XXVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>FROM THE BAR Z RANCH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Although he had promised to return early that night,
the Texan did not return at all. Dick was highly
vexed over Buckhart’s failure to come in as soon as
he had promised, finally falling asleep with the intention
to give Brad a piece of his mind in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning the Texan was still absent. Dick became
alarmed. As soon as possible he telephoned to
Mabel and learned that Brad had bidden her good
night before ten-thirty the previous evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>What had become of Buckhart? This was the question
which soon stirred up no end of excitement, but
midday delivery brought Dick a letter which he anxiously
opened, reading the following message:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Pard</span>: Suppose you’re a heap worried about
me. You needn’t be. I’m all right. Will explain on
meeting you in Providence. I’ll be there in time to
do the backstopping in that game. Depend on me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Faithfully,      <span class='sc'>Brad</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not thirty minutes behind the letter arrived a
startlingly picturesque individual who nearly pulled
the door bell out by the roots and scared Maggie when
she appeared at the door by yanking off his broad-brimmed
hat, making a sweeping bow and huskily saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are yer, miss? Is this yere the ranch where
Brad Buckhart can be found?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie was tempted to close the door in the face
of that bewhiskered, sunburned, booted, and spurred
man. From his Stetson hat to his high-heeled boots
he looked like the burlesque Western desperado seen on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the stage. Around his waist he wore a loose belt
which supported a pistol holster, the latter, however,
being empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Buckhart—he—rooms here,” faltered Maggie,
“but you see, sir—he—ain’t to home now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, that’s all right, my gal,” said the fierce-looking
man, “I’ll just walk in and wait for him. You
see I’m from his father’s ranch, the Bar Z, and the
old man axed me to look up Brad while I was on yere.
You can show me his room, little gal. I’ll squat thar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shiveringly Maggie led the way to Buckhart’s room,
into which the visitor strode with an air of perfect
self-assurance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I’m afraid you’ll have to wait an awful long
time, sir,” said the girl. “I understand Mr. Buckhart
he has gone away somewhere, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, whar’s he gone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno, sir. I dunno’s anybody knows, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick Merriwell looked in from the adjoining room.
He had the singular letter in his hand, for he was still
puzzling over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you want to see Buckhart, sir?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sure do,” answered the visitor. “Mebbe you can
tell me when he’ll git back. My name is Bill Bugle,
and I’m a cow-puncher from the Bar Z. You see the
boy’s old man axed me would I drop round and see
him and bring back a report as to how he was gittin’
along here. Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Merriwell, and I’m——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put her thar!” shouted Bugle, extending his hand.
“Why, you’re Brad’s kid pard. You’re the youngster
he’s writ so much about to his old man. I’m certain
powerful glad to meet up with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Maggie retreated, leaving them together, and in a
very short time Dick and the visitor became surprisingly
friendly. The door into the hall was closed, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>listening from the stairs some minutes later, Miss
Swazey heard Dick and Bugle laughing in the most
friendly manner. They seemed to be enjoying something
like a joke.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little later Dick gave out the contents of the letter
he had received. When its genuineness was
doubted he asserted that the writing looked like that of
Buckhart, and he was confident the Texan would show
up in Providence according to his promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the freshmen who accompanied the team to
Providence were to be seen the entire Ditson crowd.
On reaching the city they took a suite of rooms at a
medium-priced hotel, and immediately pooled every
dollar they could raise for the purpose of betting
against Yale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a dead cinch!” Mike Lynch asserted. “Without
Buckhart behind the bat Merriwell will be hammered
out of the box.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how do you know for a fact that he won’t
have Buckhart?” inquired Mel Daggett. “Of course
we all know that the Texan isn’t with the team, but
they say Merriwell has heard from him and he’s promised
to be in the game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right, Mel,” smiled Duncan Ditson
knowingly. “We have reasons to know that Buckhart
won’t show his nose on the field to-morrow. He won’t
be in the game, so don’t you worry about your money.
Here’s where we fellows make a clean-up that will put
us on our feet again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we don’t,” said Jim Poland; “if we lose, I’m
ruined this time. I don’t know how I’m going to raise
another dollar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Ditson and Lynch slept well after drinking
to their good luck, which they believed was assured.
The following forenoon the Yale men put in
some light practice on the field. They waited in vain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>for the appearance of Buckhart, although Dick remained
confident that Brad would show up.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when the time arrived for the team to dress
and proceed to the field Buckhart was still missing.
No one seemed more disappointed over this than Bill
Bugle, who hung around the boys, and, through Dick’s
intercession, was finally given permission to ride to
the field on the barge with the players.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I used to play this yere game some myself,” he
announced. “I wonder if you youngsters wouldn’t let
me git holt of the ball. I’d like to do some batting
for ye when ye practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to take you for a mascot,” said Robinson.
“If you can bat for us, we’ll let you do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was more or less laughter and joshing from
the Providence boys as the Yale team marched onto
the field with Bugle at the side of Blessed Jones. Every
one watched with intense curiosity to see what the
man would do when he seized a bat and prepared to
take part in the practice. To the surprise of all, he
hammered the ball in a scientific manner, driving it
wherever he chose and in whatever manner he chose.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Buckhart was still absent and the Yale players
were downcast. They were talking about a substitute
catcher when Bugle announced that he was going to
do the catching himself. They gave very little heed to
this until Tucker called attention to the fact that the
Westerner was shedding his garments. The man had
stepped out into an open space near the Yale bench
where he proceeded to kick off his high-heeled boots,
skin his shirt over his head, and snap himself out of
his trousers before a hand could be lifted to prevent.
These movements produced a most astonishing metamorphosis,
for beneath those outer garments Bugle
wore the baseball uniform of Yale Uumpty-ten. Not
only that, but his whiskers and long hair vanished with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the rest of his outfit, and, as he turned toward the
bench, Dick Merriwell observed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you Brad would arrive on time, boys. Here
he is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The astonishment of the Yale lads was unspeakable,
for before them stood Buckhart, smiling and wiping
some of the grease paint from his face with a soiled
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just a little joke,” explained Brad, with a wink.
“We’ll talk it over later, fellows. Now let’s get into
this game and eat Brown up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of the universal excitement the consternation
of the Ditson crowd failed to attract particular
attention. As for Lynch and Duncan, both
seemed to fancy themselves dreaming. They were
aroused by Daggett, who snarled at them:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know a lot, don’t you? You knew Buckhart
wouldn’t be here, but there he is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, there he is,” muttered Poland, who had lost
heart at once, “and Yale will win this game. Fellows,
we’re busted, every blamed one of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jim was right, for Yale put up a great game against
the clever Brown freshmen. Nevertheless, it was nobody’s
game until the eighth inning, when, with the
bases filled, Buckhart smashed out a home run that
proved to be the undoing of Brown. Among Dick’s
backers the man behind the bat was the one who really
won the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true the entire Ditson crowd was unspeakably
disgusted and sore. That night they quarreled among
themselves, and Mel Daggett wore a black eye for some
days thereafter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Dick had known for a certainty that Buckhart
would be in the game, having penetrated the disguise
of the young Texan shortly after he appeared
as Bill Bugle. The letter was a clever forgery. Brad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>had succeeded in escaping through his own efforts,
having broken the lock on the door of the wretched
room in which he found himself confined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the Texan believed there had been no intention
to perpetrate serious injury upon him, he
thirsted for revenge upon the fellows who had sought
to carry through such a rascally piece of business.
This led him to visit the costumer so often patronized
by Dick, where he secured the cowboy outfit and made
himself up to pass as a cattleman from the Bar Z.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the fact that they lost their bets doesn’t satisfy
me by a whole lot,” he declared. “I’d like to have
proof of the identity of those two gents who nabbed
me in the cab. If I ever do get such proof, I’ll light
on them all spraddled out. You hear me softly
warble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later, Dick was pitching for practice,
when a number of the members of the varsity nine
happened along and were at once struck with the wondrous
way in which Dick manipulated the ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The varsity nine is mighty weak as to pitchers,”
said one of the spectators of Dick’s skill. “I wish
it were possible to get Merriwell to help us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The others laughed at the idea of the possibility of
a mere freshman giving instructions to the men of the
varsity nine. Yet this chance remark made by a junior
classman led on to very practical results. For not
long after that Dick was called upon to give a practical
demonstration of his cleverness with the ball for the
edification of the varsity nine.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 id='XXVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A PITCHER NEEDED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For some time, indeed, there had been a feeling of
uneasiness and apprehension on the varsity nine. This
feeling culminated following the game with Williams
in which the youngsters from the hilly country came
near administering a most disgraceful trouncing to
Yale. Pitcher after pitcher was tried in the box by
the Elis, but the Williams lads seemed to find every
blue twirler an easy mark. Only for the terrific batting
of Henderson, and Cunningham’s freak home run
that sent in three men ahead of him, Williams would
have scooped the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>That there was something the matter with Yale’s
pitching staff the critics acknowledged. Efforts had
been made to keep this fact out of the newspapers, and
in some way influence had succeeded in gagging Walter
Billings, the college reporter, whose opinions in regard
to Yale athletics were highly respected and universally
conceded to be remarkably astute. But Billings
could be choked off no longer. He grimly declared
that it was for the good of the nine and forthwith
proceeded to express his opinion in print. From
him it became universally known that Yale was far
from satisfied with her pitching staff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pumper” Welch, the chief pitcher of the team, was
so sore over this that he refused to recognize Billings
for several days. Welch claimed that a slight lameness
in his arm had prevented him from doing his
best in the Williams game. No one could remember
of hearing him mention this lameness before he was
batted out of the box. More than that, he seemed
to have unusual speed that day, but the Williams lads
had a taste for speed and simply ate up his fast ones.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>In order to do its best a team must have confidence
in its pitcher. Without such confidence the players
are liable to make the most outrageous errors and in
many cases the entire team will get rattled and go to
pieces at a critical moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yale dreaded the games that lay before her. The
harder ones were to come. If Williams could be defeated
only by a fluke home run, what would happen
when the blue went up against the crimson? Harvard
had the pitchers, and everything seemed to indicate
that her team was stronger than it had been the season
before when she snatched the championship from Yale
in two straight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manager, captain, and coaches were worried. Consultations
were frequent There was any amount of
guarded talk and argument and a great deal of dubious
head-shaking. Something must be done, but what?—that
was the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>One balmy morning Dick Merriwell met Billings on
the campus. Walter squinted at Dick through his
spectacles and then stopped short and called to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Merriwell,” he said, shaking the freshman’s
hand. “How’s trix? Everything going all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“First-rate,” was the cheerful answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re pitching your arm off, boy. Now don’t
tell me you’re not. You’re doing too much. You’ll
hurt yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m pretty careful of that arm,” laughed Dick. “I
watch it and care for it as if it were a baby. I don’t
think I’ll injure it, Billings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’re doing more than half the pitching for
your team. You’re winning the games, too, and I
know you’ve got a third-rate bunch behind you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some fellows would have swelled up and looked flattered
over a compliment like this, but not so with Dick.
Instead of that he gravely protested that he thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the Umpty-ten team very good indeed. Billings grinned
but failed to provoke the freshman into the slightest
display of amused sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You talk as if you meant it,” said the reporter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do,” repeated Dick. “No pitcher can win right
along unless he has good backing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but there are a lot of soreheads who are not
playing on your team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that, and we’re better off without such fellows.
Their jealousies and ambitions make them detrimental
to the good of any team they get on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I guess that’s right,” nodded Billings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d rather have nine men who are not quite so brilliant,
but who have the right spirit and the determination
to play the game for the glory of their team
or college than to have a team made up of stars, every
one of whom is looking for his own glory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got a level head, young fellow,” said Billings.
“You’re all right. I’ve been watching you some
time. You’re a comer, and I bet my life you’ll get
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” murmured Dick, blushing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry you’re a freshman this year. Wish you
weren’t barred from varsity baseball. The varsity
needs you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t think——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” interrupted Billings quickly. “You’d be
a great help to the varsity nine. It’s no secret now
that we are weak on the slab.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are candidates enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Candidates enough, such as they are. Never in my
life saw such a swarm of fellows trying to pitch.
They’ve been culled out and sifted down to five or six
at the present time, but out of what remains there’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>not a single steady, cool-headed, reliable man with real
talent for pitching. Of course, I don’t want to be
quoted, Merriwell. I wouldn’t say this to every one,
but it’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s no danger that I’ll repeat it, Billings. It’s
a shame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a shame!” growled Walter. “Already we’ve
been beaten by some of the smaller teams. What will
happen to us when we go up against some of the better
ones? It makes me sick to think what Harvard
is sure to do to us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with Welch for a pitcher?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The trouble is right here,” answered Billings, tapping
his forehead. “Welch has speed and kinks and
all that, but he doesn’t use his head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there’s Swett. Every one seemed to think
him a wizard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a spit-ball pitcher, and that’s all you can say
about him. He hasn’t another thing but the spit ball,
and some days he’s liable to throw that straight up into
the air.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about Dud Towne?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All he knows anything about is a drop. Give him
a hard game, put him up against good batters, and
he insists on pitching that drop all the time. Result,
a lame arm constantly. He’s been told that he’ll ruin
his wing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there’s Wilbur Keene.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In my opinion he’s the most promising man we
have. He’s the youngest and the least experienced,
but he’s in earnest and he has a splendid inshoot which
is frightfully hard to hit; but he lacks confidence, and
there’s always a chance that he’ll blow up in a tight
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With proper coaching some of these fellows ought
to make good men.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“With proper coaching—there’s the rub. Welch resents
coaching. Towne is too opinionated, and set to
improve by it. Swett is so sensitive that he can’t accept
criticism. Besides that, it takes a peculiar talent
to coach a pitcher properly. I say, Merriwell, why
don’t you come out to the field this afternoon? I suppose
you’re busy with your own team, but you might
get off for an hour. Come along with me, will you?
I’d like to have your ideas concerning the practice and
the men. You might give me some hints that I can
use.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t like to do that,” said Dick. “Not for
the world would I let any one get the impression that
I had criticized the varsity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, then, don’t give me any hints, but come
out to the field. It won’t do you any hurt to stay away
from your own team’s practice to-day—it’ll do you
good. Will you come if I’ll fix it? I’ll speak to Jones
about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if you’re so eager for my society and you can
arrange it,” laughed Dick, “I’ll come.”</p>

  <h2 id='XXIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>DICK ACCEPTS A CHALLENGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The field presented a lively appearance when Billings
and Merriwell arrived that afternoon. Three or
four coachers were hard at work with the regular
players and the substitutes. Of the pitchers three were
limbering their arms while two more batted for the
practicing fielders. The manager and the head coach
were standing apart from the other men on the field,
engaged in an earnest argument. Captain Emery was
working like a Trojan, and it was plain by the expression
on his face that he was not wholly without worry.
Some forty or fifty students were scattered about in
little groups on the bleachers, watching the practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Billings was recognized the moment he appeared, but
the sudden show of interest, the sudden craning of
necks—Billings’ companion caused all this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s he doing here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s a pitcher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a shame we can’t use him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t know. He might not prove so much
in real fast company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this the fellow who had expressed regret because
the varsity was not permitted to use Dick proceeded
to straighten up and assert his belief that the freshman
was just about the hottest thing in the way of a
twirler that had been seen at Yale since the days of
his famous brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mark what I say,” said this chap, shaking a finger
in the air, “that boy is a wizard. I’ve watched
him pitch, and I know what I’m talking about. He
has some kinks up his sleeve that no one ever saw
before.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Can he throw the double shoot?” laughed a sarcastic
chap with a cigarette. “You know Frank Merriwell
had the reputation of pitching such a ball.
Why, there are fellows right here in college who really
believe he could throw a ball that would curve two
ways.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you don’t believe anything of that kind?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I look like an idiot? I admit that Merriwell
had some kind of a deceptive twist, but common sense
will tell any one that the double shoot is a rank impossibility.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was a time,” said the other, “that common
sense seemed to tell every one that any kind of a curve
was an impossibility. Even at the present time there
are lots of curves and shoots that cannot be explained
by the wisest seers. Who can give an acceptable
theory of the erratic actions of the spit ball? Sometimes
it curves slowly, sometimes it doesn’t curve at
all, and sometimes it breaks at a sharp angle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s Billings doing with Merriwell?” inquired a
curious chap. “He’s taken him over to the bench.
They’re talking with Leyden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leyden was the head coach. It happened that
Billings was simply introducing Dick to the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are things going to-day, Mr. Leyden?” inquired
the reporter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coach regarded him suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now don’t come to me for material,” he said.
“You’ve made trouble enough already, Billings. Go
ahead and write your stuff, but don’t expect assistance
from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Billings smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ve taken pains never to give away any confidences
or secrets,” he said. “No one has the good
of the team more at heart than I have. Sometimes it
becomes necessary to tell the truth. I kept still until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>outsiders began to get onto the actual condition here.
It’s no secret that Yale needs pitchers. I wish we
were in position to give this boy a trial, Leyden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He placed his hand on Dick’s shoulder as he spoke,
causing the lad to flush and look embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you know we can’t do that, and he might
not prove the man we need if we could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This boy,” said Walter, “is a natural pitcher. He’s
made a study of it, and he has a few original curves
of his own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are no original curves nowadays, Billings.
There’s nothing new in that line.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, why don’t you give Merriwell an opportunity
to pitch for batting practice? Your batting practice
is rather tame in my estimation. Can’t get a pitcher
to go out there and pitch the way he would in a game,
you know. They simply go out and throw the ball
straight over. This doesn’t do much good for the
batter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t come out to take any part in the practice,
Billings,” said Dick hastily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Discovering Merriwell, Pumper Welch came slouching
up, a sarcastic smile on his face. Welch had never
liked Dick, and he now seized the opportunity to be
nasty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Merriwell,” he said. “I suppose you’ve
come out to show us how to pitch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was something absolutely insulting in the way
these words were spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do, Welch,” bowed the freshman, his
eyes snapping a bit. “I didn’t come out to show you
how to pitch. I presume you know it all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t come to you to learn what I don’t know,”
was the instant retort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dudley Towne came forward. Like Welch, Towne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>had no love for Dick. He had not forgotten how, in
the fall games, the freshman had outpitched him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why aren’t you practicing with your team this
afternoon, Merriwell?” he inquired. “I presume you’re
such an expert that you really don’t need to practice
much of any?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Emery came trotting forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re going to get some batting practice now,” he
said. “You pitch first, will you, Towne? Wake up a
little and give ’em something to hit. Don’t simply
lob over some lazy straight ones. You haven’t got to
pitch your arm off, but you can use a few curves, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Towne scowled and looked sulky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My wing is lame, cap,” he said. “Don’t you think
I’ve used it about enough this afternoon? Of course,
I’ll pitch if you say so, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If your arm is lame, I should think you’d keep it
covered up when you get through working,” said
Emery warmly. “Why, you don’t even put on a
sweater, Towne. A man without sense enough to take
care of his arm is bound to have a lame wing the most
of the time. We can get along without you. Where’s
that freshman, Toleman? He’s the only fellow who
really does give the batters any practice that’s worth
while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Toleman hasn’t been out this afternoon,” said
Leyden. “Billings was just proposing that we should
use this youngster in batting practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, hello, Merriwell!” cried Emery cordially.
“What are you doing here? All right, come ahead
and pitch a while, will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was not my proposition,” said Dick. “I
simply came round to look on. Thought I might pick
up some points for my own benefit, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this Welch laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Just peel off and pitch a while, Merriwell,” he said.
“I wish you would. I’d like to bat against you. I’ve
never had a chance. You’re pretty clever at striking
out freshmen, but you’ll find it different against real
batters. I’m a fairly good hitter myself, and I don’t
think you could strike me out in a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps not,” admitted Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking Merriwell frightened, Welch proceeded to
rub it in by offering to give the boy ten dollars every
time he struck out if Dick would give him a dollar
for every clean hit he made.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which is the same as betting,” said Dick. “I never
bet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course he doesn’t,” chuckled Towne. “He
hasn’t sand enough. I don’t believe he has the nerve
to get out here and pitch for batting practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of batting practice is this to be?” demanded
Dick sharply. “Under ordinary circumstances
the pitching is not made too difficult for the
batter. It’s not customary in such practice for the
pitcher to deceive the batter in any possible way. Instead
of that, he is to put the ball over if he can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you’ll pitch, I shall be highly pleased to have
you deceive me in any possible manner,” said Welch.
“Just show what you can do, will you? They say Manhattan
College has a pitcher after your style, and I
just want to show the boys what I’m going to do to
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead, Merriwell,” urged Emery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus challenged, Dick proceeded to pull off his coat
and get ready for business.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>
  <h2 id='XXX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FRESHMAN PITCHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick had not come out for that purpose, and he
gave Billings a good-natured frown, receiving in return
an equally good-natured smile of satisfaction.
Things had happened exactly the way Billings had
hoped they would. It was his belief that Merriwell
could show the varsity pitchers a few tricks, but the
boy was not the kind voluntarily to show off, and the
pride and prejudice of the varsity pitchers would prevent
them from seeking any tips of a freshman.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be confessed that Merriwell’s blood had been
warmed a little by the unconcealed sneering of Welch
and Towne. He knew both of these fellows disliked
him heartily, and, to tell the truth, he was not inclined
to waste any love on them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having practically stated that he would do all sorts
of things to Dick’s delivery, Welch sought permission
to lead off in the batting and was given a nod by
Emery.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time Billings was a trifle worried, for
he feared the freshman might not be up to his usual
form. If this should be the case and the boy was
batted freely and heavily, Billings knew he would “get
the laugh” from those chaps who were eagerly watching
for him to make a mistake in judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As this is not to be ordinary batting practice,
Emery,” he said, “why don’t you appoint an umpire to
call balls and strikes? That’s the only way to make
a fair test of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might do that, Leyden,” suggested Emery.
“It will give you a chance to watch the kid’s curves.
You can tell in a few moments if he has anything up
his sleeve.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The coach jogged out and took his position back of
the pitcher’s stand. A few of the regulars and a
number of subs were placed on bases and in the field.
Del Cranch, the catcher, leisurely sauntered into position
some twenty-five feet behind the batter. There
was no reason why he should get under the stick where
he might be hurt, just to limber his arm a bit, Dick
threw a few balls to the chap on first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now watch me pound this wonderful freshman’s
curves,” invited Welch, in a low tone, as he walked
out to the plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pumper is too confident,” muttered Dudley Towne.
“I’ve batted against Merriwell, and he isn’t easy, although
I wouldn’t tell him so for the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The first ball delivered by Dick looked good to
Welch, but it took a queer inward twist, passing close
to his knees, and he did not even foul it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One strike,” called Leyden. “You’ll have to use
better judgment than that, Welch. It didn’t even
cross the inside corner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pumper shrugged his shoulders and grinned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just wanted to encourage him, that’s all,” he said.
“Now he’ll have to put ’em over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next two balls were wide, which made it
seem that Dick’s control was rather poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, come! come!” cried the batter. “You can’t
fool me, kid. Don’t wear yourself out. Don’t waste
your strength. Get ’em over, get ’em over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even as Pumper was speaking Dick delivered a
speedy one that seemed to make the air sizzle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Welch struck under it at least a foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, hello,” muttered Leyden, “that was a pretty
jump ball. Can you throw it when you wish, youngster?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I’m in proper form, I can. Occasionally I can’t
make it jump as much as I would like. It’s one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>hardest balls to pitch, because there seems to be no
regular way to throw it that will give positive and
consistent results. Sometimes when I try hardest to
make it jump it pans out to be merely a high straight
ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you pitch a raise ball the same as you do the
jump?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no,” answered Dick quickly. “The two are
pitched in entirely different ways. The jump is the
result of extreme speed with an overhand delivery.
I’ll pitch the raise ball now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These final words were spoken in such a low tone
that they did not reach the ears of Welch. Grasping
the ball exactly as if he meant to pitch an outcurve,
Dick swung his arm, dropping his hand nearly to the
level of his knee. The ball left his hand and came
floating up toward the batter’s shoulder in a most deceptive
manner. There was no great speed, and it
seemed easy enough to hit the ball. Nevertheless,
Welch struck under it, for, even though he knew it
was a rise, he found it something he could not accurately
gauge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One strike-out,” called Leyden. “Try again,
Pumper. Perhaps you’ll do better next time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A tinge of red leaped into the cheeks of Welch,
and he bit his lips angrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that’s once,” he admitted. “I’m all through
encouraging the kid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve been very kind,” said Dick, with mock
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s laughing at you, Welch,” whispered Towne
behind his outspread hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pumper set his teeth and squared his jaw, gripping
the bat fiercely. An outcurve nearly led him into
reaching, but he checked himself just in time for Leyden
to call a ball instead of a strike. Another outcurve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>followed and Welch edged up close to the rubber,
his toes almost touching it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick now grasped the ball firmly with two fingers,
while his curved thumb touched it very lightly. Keeping
his hand in an upright position as he swung, he let
the ball go over the tips of his fingers with a lateral
motion. All the speed he could command was put into
this delivery. When the ball left his fingers it was
turning from right to left and apparently aimed to
cross the outside corner of the plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as Welch swung the sphere took a sudden inshoot,
and he actually felt its breath as it twisted past
his ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Realizing he had been deceived by a high inshoot
that had nearly hit him, Welch snarled at the freshman:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out there! You came near hitting me in the
head then! You want to be careful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you’d been hit in the head, Pumper, you might
have blamed yourself,” said Leyden. “You’re standing
on top of the rubber. Get back the proper distance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Welch was both angry and ashamed.
He sullenly moved back from the plate, feeling his
blood leaping hotly in his veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got to hit the next one I swing at,” he thought.
“I’ve got to—and I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of this determination, he merely fouled the
next ball he went after.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saved yourself by touching it,” said Leyden.
“You still have a chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far, with the single exception of the raise
ball, Dick had been using speed. He now swung overhand
as if intending to throw a swift one, but when
the ball left his fingers it seemed to hang in the air
as if some invisible force was retarding it. Welch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>saw it coming and knew it would cross the pan fairly.
He was impatient to hit at it, and, in spite of himself,
he could not wait until the ball was near enough.
Swinging far too soon, he missed it entirely. Some
of the spectators laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Welch longed to send his bat spinning at Dick Merriwell’s
head, for there is nothing so provoking to a
batter as to be fooled by a slow ball. It makes him
feel foolish, and the laughter that invariably greets his
ears arouses his ire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s two strike-outs, and you haven’t even hit a
little one into the diamond, Welch,” reminded Leyden.
“The youngster is fooling you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Welch was at a loss for words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s Henderson?” cried some one. “Carl’s the
man to bump that sort of pitching.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henderson was the most reliable batter on the
Yale team. The pitcher who could strike him out had
good reason to plume himself on his feat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not through yet,” declared Welch hastily.
“I’m just getting his measure. In batting practice we
always have three hits at the ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there are others who wish to try their skill
some time this afternoon, you know,” drawled Billings.
“If they wait for you to get three hits, Welch,
I’m afraid they won’t have a chance to try their luck
at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yar!” muttered Pumper to himself. “That bighead
Billings always did make me sick! He says the
varsity is weak in the box. I suppose the next thing
that will happen he’ll write an article claiming the
freshmen have a better pitcher than the varsity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t go off in a trance, Welch!” cried Leyden, as
the ball whistled past the batter. “That ball was
straight over the heart of the pan, but you didn’t see it,
and I won’t call a strike on you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Again Pumper heard a titter, and by this time his
blood was being pumped through his veins in such a
manner that it caused a hammering sound in his ears.
He glared at Dick with the most malicious hatred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on! come on!” he snapped. “I’m waiting!
When you get through showing off and playing your
monkey tricks perhaps you’ll settle down and pitch in
a decent manner!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell made no retort, but deliberately tossed up
a straight ball that cut the plate in two equal halves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Welch, however, could not believe Merriwell had
thrown a straight one, and swinging in anticipation
of a curve, he made another clean miss. After all
his boasting he was making a sorry spectacle of himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following this Pumper managed to foul the ball
twice, but he ended by biting at another jump and being
again declared out by Leyden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, give somebody else a chance, Welch,” called
Captain Emery. “Let’s see if the freshman is invincible.
Come on, Henderson, show us what you can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pumper turned and savagely flung his bat toward
the pile lying near the bench. Even Towne joined in
the chaffing that was tossed after him as he retired
from the plate.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Two of the pitchers, Sweet and Keene, were now
behind Cranch, watching the freshman’s curves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see that he has anything in particular, do
you?” muttered Swett.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing remarkable,” said Keene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has good control for one thing,” observed
Cranch. “He can put the ball just where he wants
to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” came from Swett. “He doesn’t put
them all over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He doesn’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most pitchers try to in batting practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you seem to forget that the freshman was up
against a challenge. Pumper made some talk about
pounding him all over the field.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Pumper’s great on making talk,” said Swett.
“He doesn’t mean half he says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he’s sore now,” declared Keene, as Welch
hurled his bat aside and walked toward the bench.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now take a lesson by that fellow,” muttered
Cranch. “I’ve told him time after time that his temper
spoiled his pitching. When things go wrong in a
game he acts just as he’s acting now. A pitcher who
permits himself to get wrathy never can do his best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we’ll see what Henderson can do to the
freshie,” said Swett. “Old Hen ought to biff him
some.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick knew he was up against the crack batter of
the varsity, and his first inclination was not to attempt
to strike Henderson out. The first ball he delivered
was straight over, and Carl smashed it out on a
line.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Clean hit!” cried Leyden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s different now! it’s different now!” shouted
a voice. “The freshie will find he’s pitching against
a real batter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What fool said that?” snarled Welch, glaring
around in search of the speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whoever it was, the fellow kept himself out of
sight for the time being.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick saw Swett and Keene laughing behind Cranch.
There were other players behind those fellows, all eager
to watch the work of young Merriwell. The boy was
now spurred to do his best.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ball was returned to him Dick settled himself
for business. Three times he pitched the jump
to Henderson and three times Henderson fouled.
Then a sharp twisting drop caused the batter to make
a clean miss, and Merriwell secured the credit of a
strike-out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well! well! well!” shouted a fellow on the bleachers.
“What’s the matter with Hen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Welch sat up and took notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he can strike Henderson out again,” thought
Pumper, “I won’t feel so bad over my own batting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The great Yale hitter leaned over the rubber plate
and thumped it with the end of his “slugger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was first-rate, Merriwell,” he nodded. “You
certainly caught me napping.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later Henderson batted a slow grounder
into the diamond. It was gathered cleanly and
snapped to first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No hit,” came from Leyden. “That would have
been an easy out at first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of that, Swett?” muttered
Wilbur Keene. “Hen doesn’t seem to be hitting
the freshman very hard.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Wait,” said Swett, “Carl is taking Merriwell’s
measure. I reckon he’ll baste it next time he swings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dick was taking Henderson’s measure, and by
this time he had learned something of the great batter’s
weak points. Two fouls followed, and then, for
the first time that day, Dick used the combination
ball. It started like a rise, but shifted into a drop,
and once more Henderson experienced the mortification
of striking out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, give me a chance,” laughed Captain Emery,
seizing a bat and trotting out to the plate. “Of course
I don’t expect to do any better than you fellows, but I
want to see why it is you can’t hit him. He looks
easy enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emery was a left-hand hitter. The moment he
saw this, Dick shifted his position, took the ball in
his left hand, and pitched in that manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on! hold on!” cried Emery. “You’re right-handed.
What are you doing, anyhow, Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I pitch with either hand,” smiled Dick. “As a
rule, I use my left hand when I find myself up against
a left-hand hitter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, by Jove, I knew that, but I’d forgotten it!”
said Emery. “You’re the only pitcher I ever saw who
could really do that trick. Have you any speed with
your left?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not much,” answered Dick; but a moment later he
sent over a left-hander that seemed to make the air
smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, not a bit of speed—not a bit!” cried Emery,
who struck and missed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having struck the Yale captain out, Dick seemed
satisfied, for he made no further effort to secure
strike-outs, although he continued pitching for ten
minutes or more. Once in a while he would send in
a queer shoot or curve that would bewilder the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>at bat, but he did not keep himself constantly at his
best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Toleman had arrived on the field as Dick walked
out to pitch. After watching Merriwell a while,
Toleman retired to the bleachers and listened to the
comments of the spectators. What he overheard did
not seem to please him, and finally, in a surly manner,
he left the field. Keene was called out to pitch when
Dick stopped. Leyden walked in to the bench with the
freshman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think about the boy, Bill?”
asked Billings, who was smiling with a great deal of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coach scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He certainly has the kinks and the control,” he
admitted. “I’ve never seen him pitch in a game, but
if he has a level head I should say he’s all the mustard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This pleased Billings, who proceeded to call Emery
and Leyden aside where he could speak to them
privately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want you gentlemen to think I’m butting
in,” he said, “but, of course, you know that I have
the interest of the team at heart just as much as any
one. I’m not here to give you any advice, but if you
won’t be offended, I’ll make a suggestion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They exchanged glances, and then Emery said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll listen to your suggestion, Billings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” nodded Leyden. “We don’t have to accept
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not,” said Walter quickly. “It’s rather
unusual, I will admit; but why not get Merriwell to
coach the varsity pitchers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emery looked astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unusual?” he cried. “I should say so. Whoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>heard of such a thing? Whoever heard of a freshman
coaching men on the varsity nine?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there’s no reason why a freshman should not
do such a thing if he’s capable, is there? I don’t know
of any reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I,” admitted Emery, turning to Leyden.
“What do you think of this peculiar proposition, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leyden was a Yale grad. Had he been a professional
coach, it is likely he would have received
Billings’ proposal with scornful derision; but, really
having the good of the team at heart, he now admitted
that there was, to his knowledge, no reason why a
freshman should not coach any member of any varsity
team.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will he do it?” asked Emery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think he’ll do anything in his power to help his
college. He has the right spirit. He’s a true Yale
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must be pretty busy on his own team,” said
Leyden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is,” nodded Billings. “Still, I think he would
find a little time to do this work I’ve suggested.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he undertook to coach all our pitchers, it would
take his entire time,” said Leyden. “We must pick
out a man and turn him over to Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good suggestion,” nodded Emery. “Let’s see
what the youngster can do with one man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whom will you choose?” questioned Billings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welch is our best pitcher. If he could get some
of Merriwell’s kinks, it would make us strong in the
box. I suggest Welch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later Pumper was called by Emery.
Wondering what they wanted, he sauntered up and
joined them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain of the nine quickly explained Billings’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>proposal. Before Emery had finished speaking the
lips of Welch had begun to curl disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Preposterous!” he exclaimed, giving Walter a
scornful look. “Why, there isn’t a man on the team
who’ll be coached by that freshman. The fellow has
a terrible swelled head, anyhow. If he got a chance
to coach a member of the varsity nine, he’d be simply
intolerable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Billings surveyed Pumper from head to heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welch,” he said, “I’ve never yet seen a fellow as
capable as Merriwell who was so absolutely modest
and unassuming. When you say he has a swelled head
you do so without reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I do,” growled Welch. “But what made
him come out here and show off to-day?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I induced him to come, and as for showing off he
was literally baited into doing what he did. I believe
that you announced that you were going to show what
you would do to some pitcher who resembles Merriwell.
Well, you demonstrated precisely what you will
do. If you ever get up against a pitcher like Merriwell,
you’ll strike out. If that boy wasn’t a freshman
and barred from the varsity on that account, Yale
would have a cinch at the college baseball championship
this year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flush had left Pumper’s face, and he was now
quite pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what business you have to meddle
with baseball affairs, Billings!” he cried hotly.
“You’re always spying around to get hold of something
you can write up for the papers. You betray
Yale’s athletic secrets in order to get a few paltry
dollars for your greedy pockets. It’s mighty contemptible
business, I think. This coaching idea was
suggested by you, and, therefore, I wouldn’t accept
it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Hold on, Welch,” came quickly from Emery;
“you forget yourself. I’m captain of the team.
What I say——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you say goes, captain,” interrupted Pumper.
“It goes with me as long as I remain on the team;
but if you attempt to put that freshman over me as a
coach, I’ll get off the team. I beg your pardon for
speaking like this, but I was forced into it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 id='XXXII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>CUT DOWN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick was crossing the campus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Merry!” cried one of the group near the
fence. “They tell me you’re pitching for the varsity
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet, Peterson,” smiled Dick, unruffled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet, but soon, I suppose. Toleman says you
were out for practice with the varsity team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Note the haughtiness of his manner,” cried another
chap. “I suppose the rules will be suspended in
order to permit him to pitch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much more of this sort of chaffing, but
Dick took it all good-naturedly and passed on his way.
Buckhart was sitting on the steps of the house on
York Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, pard!” he cried. “Waiting for you. She’s
a baby!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s a baby?” asked Dick, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Sallie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your who?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sallie. She’s a trim little girl. Light and airy
and just my size.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, what ails you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on and let’s hit the grub pile,” said Brad.
“After we fill our baskets I’m going to introduce you
to Sallie. You’ll love her, I know you will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you had better excuse me,” said Dick.
“I’m too busy just now to make the acquaintance of
your Sallie, whoever the delightful damsel is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan chuckled but continued to insist that
Dick must meet Sallie. Nor would Brad accept no
for an answer. In the soft twilight they made their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>way down to the harbor front, and there, lying among
other boats at a float, was one toward which the Texan
led his chum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s <i>Sallie</i>,” said Brad, with a proud wave of
his hand. “I told you I was going to buy a boat, and
I’ve done it. Paid thirty-five dollars for her. How
do you like her, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So this is <i>Sallie</i>?” laughed Merriwell. “Well, by
Jove! I expected to meet a fair damsel with golden
hair and heavenly blue eyes. She looks good to me,
Brad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get the oars, boy,” said the Texan, turning to a
rather tough-looking youngster who had charge of the
boats. “Bring both pair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few moments the oars were brought and placed
in the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Brad, “we’re going to be able to enjoy
a row every night. Three times we’ve been down here
after a boat and couldn’t get anything better than an
old scow. There’ll be no more of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a soft haze on the harbor as the boys
swung out from amid the piers. Both handled the
oars skillfully, and the light rowboat seemed to glide
over the surface of the water with scarcely a ripple.
Here and there a light was commencing to gleam
along the shore. On the vessels red and green lights
were also being hoisted. Still, there was a golden
afterglow in the western sky, which flung its orange
reflection over the water. From one of the vessels
at anchor came the sound of singing. Other rowboats
were gliding hither and thither amid the shipping.
The air was cool and refreshing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is great!” exclaimed Dick, with satisfaction.
“By Jove! this will be a good thing for us every night,
Brad. I’m glad you bought <i>Sallie</i>, and I agree with
you that <i>Sallie</i> is a peach.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“If it wasn’t for baseball,” said the Texan, “I’d
sure go in for rowing. A fellow can’t do both and
cut much ice at either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!” called Dick, looking over his shoulder.
“There’s a small steam launch cutting our course ahead
of us. Let’s not try to run her down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They shifted their course, but a moment later, to
their surprise, they found that the launch had also
changed its course and was heading almost directly
for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonder what they’re trying to celebrate?” growled
Buckhart. “Can’t they see us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Starboard, pull—pull hard!” cried Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Brad misunderstood and pulled hard with his
port oar, which offset the efforts of Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a rushing swish, the tiny steam launch puffed
down upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!” roared the Texan. “Keep off! You’ll
run us down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Apparently the pilot of the launch did not hear this
cry, for an instant later, with a cutting crash, the sharp
prow of the craft struck the rowboat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan had dropped his oars and risen to his
feet. With an electrified spring, he seized the gunwale
of the launch and held fast as the rowboat melted
beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twice the Texan shouted for help. His feet and
ankles were caught by a rushing current of water and
this brought a strain upon his hands which threatened
to break his grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that at last his cries were heard, for some
one looked over the gunwale and discovered him clinging
there. Looking upward, the Texan found himself
gazing straight into the evil, malicious eyes of Mike
Lynch.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h2 id='XXXIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE RED STAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For a moment Lynch seemed to leer triumphantly
at Brad, who realized only too well his own desperate
plight. The Texan knew the probable result of losing
his hold and being carried beneath the swiftly moving
launch. In a moment almost the boat would pass over
him and the whirling screw would cut and mangle him
with its churning blades. It was sure death to let go.</p>

<p class='c007'>And still he knew his hold would be broken unless
he received aid within a very few seconds. He could
feel his fingers slipping on the smooth, moist rail of
the launch—slipping, slipping, slipping. Above him
bent the face of a fellow who hated him with an intensity
that was really deadly. Lynch was a vindictive,
revengeful fellow, who would stop at nothing
in order to injure a person who had aroused his enmity.
In those moments of distress and anxiety, Buckhart
was struck by the thought that this malicious
young ruffian had deliberately brought about the running
down of the <i>Sallie</i>. Having seen Dick and Brad
in the rowboat, Mike had deliberately cut them down.</p>

<p class='c007'>But where was Dick? As this question flashed
through the Texan’s brain he was seized with a shuddering,
sickening sensation of horror. Merriwell had
vanished as the launch smashed into the rowboat, which
was cut in two like a frail eggshell. If overwhelmed
and carried beneath the launch, of course Dick had
been struck by the propeller.</p>

<p class='c007'>That meant death. It meant that the boy’s mangled
body might be found drifting at the will of the harbor
tides. It meant that he might be left lifeless, gruesome,
and ghastly, upon the muddy flats when the tide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>receded. Perchance he might be carried out into the
great Sound, the blue waters of which were traversed
by hundreds of sailing vessels, huge white passenger
steamers, and the magnificent pleasure yachts of
money-squandering millionaires. It was murder, and
this creature Lynch had committed the crime!</p>

<p class='c007'>With a snarl, a showing of his strong teeth, a fire
gleam of his eyes, the Texan strained and lifted himself
in the effort to swing over the rail and reach the
wretch who hovered above him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little chance he had of doing that through his own
efforts. Apparently Mike understood what Buckhart
was trying to do, for in a moment he seized the Texan’s
hands and tore them from the slippery rail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You cur!” groaned the helpless boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even as he expected to be dropped into the hissing
water Mike shouted for assistance, and a second
person joined him, bending over the rail and getting
a grip on Brad’s coat between the shoulder blades of
the Texan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hoist away!” cried Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>An instant later the bewildered boy was dragged
over the rail and found himself floundering in the
bottom of the launch.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were four persons in the boat. The one at
the wheel was a rather rough-looking, bearded man.
The others were Mike Lynch, Duncan Ditson, and
Harold Du Boise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson had assisted Lynch in lifting Buckhart to
safety. Du Boise, sitting in the stern, stared at the
rescued youth with an air of dopey comprehension.
Lynch swore, and Ditson expressed his feelings by
crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of that? What the dickens
were you trying to celebrate, Buckhart?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just pulled right in front of me,” said the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>at the wheel. “Couldn’t help hitting his boat. She’s
gone, and he can consider himself mighty lucky that
he didn’t go under with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan sat up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lunatic at the wheel!” he roared. “You deliberately
ran us down! My pard—where is he?
You’ve killed him! You’ve murdered him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?” exclaimed Lynch. “Was there any
one with you in the boat we struck?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know there was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t see you at all,” asserted Ditson. “We
were sitting aft when we heard the crash and felt a
slight shock. Even then I didn’t know what had happened.
Berger said we’d hit a rowboat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sprang forward and looked over,” said Lynch.
“Saw you clinging to the rail. This is mighty bad
business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn back—turn back!” cried Buckhart. “Dick
Merriwell was carried down when you smashed my
boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn back at once, Berger,” commanded Ditson.
“By Jove! this is bad. There are the pieces of the
boat, but I can’t see a sign of Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The débris of the wrecked boat lay floating on the
orange-tinted waves, but Duncan spoke truly when he
said there was no sign of Dick. Buckhart rose to
his knees and stared heart sick along the wake of
the launch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone!” he said. “He could swim like a fish, and
we’d see something of him if he had not been injured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man at the wheel brought the launch round
with a sharp, sweeping curve.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slower, Berger,” commanded Duncan. “Here, let
me have that wheel. You look after your steam.
Keep your eyes open, Mike. Can you see anything of
Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>In the stern Du Boise stirred slightly and drawled:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you say you were going to hit the boat
before we struck it, Mike? I thought you said something
about a rowboat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re dreaming!” snapped Lynch. “You didn’t
hear us say anything of the sort. Did he, Berger?
We didn’t see the boat, did we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not until it was too late to avoid it,” answered
the bearded man, who was now monkeying with the
steam valves. “I’m not running down rowboats for
pleasure, although it’s a wonder the fools who row
around the harbor don’t get run down oftener than
they do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buckhart was saying not a word now. With his
strong hands gripping the rail, he leaned forward,
gazing at the placid water where the golden tint was
gradually changing to a dull reddish color like stagnant
blood. They slipped past a huge black hulk that
lay anchored near the spot where the catastrophe had
occurred. Under the eastern rail of this vessel the
shadows were almost inky black.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve passed the spot, Lynch,” muttered Ditson.
“I’m afraid Merriwell’s gone down for good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid he has,” whispered Mike huskily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn back,” came hoarsely from Buckhart’s lips.
“We’ll cruise around this locality as long as there’s a
ghost of a hope left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Duncan brought the boat round, and they retraced
their course. This was repeated over and over until
the afterglow of sunset had faded in the west and
darkness shrouded the entire bosom of the harbor.
Not until Buckhart huskily confessed that he no
longer hoped did Lynch or Ditson propose abandoning
the search. They had been questioned by other
persons, and a number of boats were moving about in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>that vicinity, while the report of a collision and a
drowning had been carried to the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan seemed completely overcome by the horrible
thing that had happened. Not a word did he
speak after the search was abandoned until the launch
swung alongside a float where they were to disembark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve tried all sorts of tricks to down my pard
and myself,” he observed, fixing his gaze on Lynch
and Ditson. “At last you’ve succeeded in murdering
one of the whitest lads who ever lived. I said murder,
and that is the word I meant to use. Don’t tell me
you didn’t see our boat. Don’t tell me you didn’t
run us down intentionally. And don’t you think for
an instant that you’re going to escape paying the penalty
for the crime. You can’t lie out of it. There
are four of you in the secret, and some one of you
will make a false step and trip you all up. This thing
shall be investigated, I give you my word. If the
body is found, you’ll have a chance to face the coroner’s
jury. If it isn’t found, you’ll have a chance to
face a jury just the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you’re daffy, Buckhart!” exclaimed Ditson.
“You must be bughouse to think we’d deliberately do
anything like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you wouldn’t stop at anything. Perhaps
you didn’t mean to drown either one of us when you
ran us down. Perhaps you thought it would be a fine
joke to smash our boat and give us a ducking. Well,
you see what’s come of your fine joke. Dick Merriwell
is at the bottom of the harbor, and you, you miserable
spawn of the earth—you have his blood on your
hands! You can’t wash it off. The stain will cling
there even as it clung to the hands of Lady Macbeth.
And retribution is as sure for you as it was for her.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>He left them there shivering in the launch with a
sudden chill that came not wholly from the cool breath
that crept in over the dark surface of the harbor.
They watched his dark bulk as he mounted the steps
from the float, nor did they speak until the sound of
his feet died out upon the pier.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch was the first to break the silence. He forced
a laugh as he turned to Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got something interesting to look for,”
he observed, with an air of bravado. “Mr. Buckhart
was very theatrical in his threats.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I’d ever thought it would end this way——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike checked his companion by suddenly gripping
Dunc’s arm and hissing:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shut up! Don’t talk like that now! Of course we
didn’t mean to drown either one of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Berger stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s something coming to me, gents,” he said.
“Don’t forget it. You made me a proposition to run
down that boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you want to forget all about that, my man!”
remarked Mike. “You’ll get the money, all right, but
you don’t want to tell any one that there was any
understanding between us. The whole thing was an
accident. Nobody saw the rowboat until just as we
struck it. Say so and stick to it—unless you want to
do a turn in the stone jug.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The money——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch stepped close to Du Boise, to whom he spoke
in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got to have some more money, Hal,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“We’ve got to put a plaster over that man’s mouth.
Cough up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, hold on,” protested Hal, after reaching into
his pocket. “Seems to me you’re inclined to push this
thing too far. I’ve coughed up enough already. I’ve
been paying your bills for the last three days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ever since I caught you skinning a bunch of easy
marks with marked cards,” said Mike. “I saved
you from exposure by getting away with those cards
and substituting another pack when I found two of
the fellows were planning to make an investigation.
You ought to be grateful, Du Boise. You’re not as
clever as you were once. There was a time when you
didn’t have to use ordinary markers to win at poker.
The pace you’ve been hitting has proved too much for
you. But you made a fine haul off those suckers, and
when they insisted on examining the cards not a thing
could be proved against you, thanks to me. It was
lucky I had a pack in my pocket with backs almost
exactly like those markers. The resemblance was
sufficient to fool the most of those chaps. Why, you
thought you were cornered yourself until you picked
up one of the cards and examined it closely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” nodded Du Boise. “Even then I
wondered if I wasn’t dreaming. I didn’t know how
it happened until you got me alone and explained. I
think I’ve shown my appreciation. It’s cost me over
a hundred dollars already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you I’ll square with you when I’m flush
again. I went broke on that Providence game, and I
had to raise money by hook or crook. You came like
a delivering angel, Hal. I’ve got to pay Berger twenty-five
dollars before we leave him this evening. Hand
it over, old chap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a sigh, Du Boise drew forth his money, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>holding it close to his eyes, separated four bills from
the roll, three fives and a ten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch took this money and gave it to Berger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There it is,” he said, in a low tone. “Now let
that keep your tongue still. If you don’t, you’re liable
to find yourself in a nasty scrape. You were doing
the steering, and, therefore, you were the one most
responsible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” agreed Ditson quickly. “If you think
to get out of this business by turning State’s evidence,
we’ll swear we were not in earnest when we suggested
you should run that boat down. We’ll say we were
only joking. We’ll deny we ever gave you a cent of
money for that piece of work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you’d better hold up right where you are,”
growled the man, with an intonation of disgust. “I’m
no fool.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know about that,” muttered Lynch. “If
I’d been in your place, twenty-five dollars never would
have tempted me to run down a rowboat containing
two persons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You heard the threat of the chap who escaped,”
said Ditson. “He’s the kind of a fellow to make good.
He talks a whole lot, but he means what he says. You
want to stand on your guard all the while. Don’t let
any one pump you. Of course you’ll be questioned
about the affair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t have to have no advice from youngsters
like you,” growled Berger, as he thrust the money
deep into a safe pocket. “You take care of yourselves,
and I’ll take care of myself. You want to look
out that you don’t get tripped up. I reckon you’d better
report this business to the authorities. I’m going
to see the harbor master myself. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Silently they mounted the steps from the float and
paused, a shivering group, on the unlighted pier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The little launch, with lights set, swung out from the
float and puffed away. Ditson stood gazing out over
the inky harbor, a feeling of horror threatening to
take possession of him and turn his blood to ice water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bad! bad!” he muttered. “If I’d only thought
what might happen! But I knew Merriwell could swim
like a fish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, cut that out!” growled Mike. “It’s no use
getting sloppy now. What I want is a drink, and I
want it right away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Du Boise buttoned his light overcoat and shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I need a bracer myself,” he said. “Let’s get one
quick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They patronized the first saloon they came to, which
proved to be a rather disreputable-appearing sailors’
resort. Lynch and Ditson ordered whisky, but Hal
called for absinthe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We don’t have none of dat here,” said the barkeeper.
“Dem fancy drinks don’t go wit’ our customers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I suppose I’ll have to take the same as my
friends,” murmured Du Boise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whisky was of the vilest sort, and he shuddered
and gasped after it had passed down his throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A man who can drink that can stand anything,”
he said, as he paid the bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the fiery drink they had swallowed, their
blood remained chill and sluggish, and a terrible load
seemed weighting down their hearts. Ditson could not
help thinking of Dick Merriwell lying beneath the
dark waters of the harbor. The gruesome vision
haunted him, and finally he fiercely exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s go where we can get some decent whisky.
Confound it all, I’m frozen clean to my marrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’ll we go?” inquired Du Boise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Let’s go to Fred’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And let’s get off this dark street,” said Lynch,
who had been casting occasional glances over his
shoulders. “I can’t shake off the feeling that some one
is following us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps some one is following us,” said Du Boise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh?” exclaimed Duncan, also glancing round. “I
don’t see anybody. There’s no one behind us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps there is,” said Hal. “Maybe you can’t
see him even though he is there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean? Who do you think is following
us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A ghost,” was the whispered answer. “I don’t
dare to look round, fellows, but I can feel it. It’s
right at our heels.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, rats!” sneered Lynch, forcing a hoarse laugh.
“If you believe in ghosts, you’re a big fool, Du Boise.
There are no such things. I’m not the least bit superstitious
myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what makes you look round? You know
there’s no living thing behind you, yet you keep turning
your head to peer over your shoulder. You don’t
see anything, but you can feel it just the same as I
can. Ditson feels it, too. We all know it’s there, fellows.
I’m afraid the thing will follow us the rest of
our lives. I’m afraid we’ll never be able to get away
from it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Heaven’s sake, cut that out!” entreated Ditson.
“Like Lynch, I’m not superstitious, but I swear
you’ve got my teeth chattering by your silly talk. I
agree with you, Mike. This street is too dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hasten their footsteps as they might, they could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>escape from the uncanny conviction that something
silent and ghostly and terrible was hovering at their
very heels. Even the better-lighted streets did not
banish that feeling, and by the time they reached Fred’s
the three were in a terrible state of funk.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h2 id='XXXV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>AN APPARITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not a little to their satisfaction, they found that one
of the card rooms upstairs was unoccupied. Not wishing
to be seen at the bar by acquaintances, as they
were beginning to feel that their faces bore the stamp
of guilt, they made haste to mount the stairs to that
little room where they could seclude themselves and
order such drinks as they fancied might steady their
shaken nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike and Duncan stuck to whisky, but Du Boise
called for an absinthe frappé.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s nothing like it,” he asserted. “I’ve tried
everything when my nerves needed bracing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a deadly poison,” said Ditson. “I see they’re
trying to pass a law in France that will make the
manufacture of absinthe unlawful in one year and the
sale unlawful in two years. Absinthe is one of the
most potent influences in the degeneracy of the drinking
people of France. Why, man alive, if you were
to give a horse an ounce or two of absinthe, it would
throw the animal into convulsions and might cause
its death. If you yourself were to drink it the way
you would swallow a drink of whisky, the chances
are it would knock you stiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this Harold simply shrugged his shoulders and
smiled a pale, bloodless smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that’s not the way to drink absinthe,” he said.
“The man who drinks whisky that way simply throws
it down his throat in order to get the effect. To get
the effect of absinthe, you sip it slowly. If your nerves
are in a bad state, if your luck is rotten, if the world
has turned its face against you, just try a little absinthe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>I need it this minute. It works like a magic
charm. Gradually all the shadows disperse and flee
away, the sun smiles upon you and the weeds beneath
your feet blossom into the most lovely flowers. A
sensation of peace and buoyancy and confidence and
contentment gradually pervades your entire being.
From a dark and dreary cave the world changes into
a glorious, heaven-smiling paradise. There’s nothing
quite like absinthe to accomplish this marvelous change.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t mind telling you, fellows, that I’ve tried almost
everything. Opium works nicely in a way, but
it seems to interest you rather too much in other people.
Their pleasures become your pleasures. The
most trivial things are sufficient to amuse you. You
watch a laborer and his wife marketing on a Saturday
night, and somehow it is better than the finest
theatrical performance you have ever witnessed. Your
heart goes out to those humble people, and you accept
them as kin to you, blood relatives as it were. A child
playing with a top fills you with unspeakable satisfaction
and sympathy. A dove building its nest may
chain your attention for hours. Through such trivial
things you are made supremely content and satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Other drugs with which I have experimented produce
different effects, but they all bring about a relapse
in time, and you suffer the most horrible tortures as
retaliation for the pleasures that have been yours.
With absinthe I have not yet reached the point where
it retaliates and inflicts torments. It has helped me
shake off the grip opium had upon me. I prefer absinthe
to opium.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s simply a case of taking one poison as an antidote
for another,” said Ditson. “The time will come,
Du Boise, when you’ll find your blood entirely eaten
up by the poisons you have absorbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And by your looks,” said Lynch, “I should say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>that is not very far away. Never knew a chap to
change the way you have in the past four months.
It’s a wonder to me that you’ve managed to stick in
college this long. Don’t you realize what is coming
to you? Can’t you see your finish?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I did realize it in time to escape,” said Hal.
“I began experimenting with opium for amusement.
I wanted to experience the effect. I had no idea of
letting the stuff get a hold on me, but when I found it
had I fled to absinthe, and absinthe has proved my
salvation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will prove your destruction,” declared Duncan.
“You’re its slave to-day, and you’ll never break away
from it. Here are our drinks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the wall a sliding panel shot back, and through
the opening could be seen the face of the waiter who
had brought the drinks. He pushed in a tray, which
Lynch received. The drinks were removed from the
tray and placed on the table. Du Boise tossed some
money on the tray, which was then passed back through
the opening. The sliding panel closed softly, and they
were again alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s to forgetfulness,” said Du Boise, lifting the
glass, which was filled with fine cracked ice and a
greenish-amber liquid. “Here’s to forgetfulness, but I
fear you’ll not find it in the stuff you are drinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson’s hand shook a bit as he lifted his glass of
whisky and literally tossed it down his throat. Du
Boise sipped softly at the absinthe. In a moment a
dreamy light seemed creeping into his faded eyes. Before
long a bit of color mounted into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should we worry about anything in this world
or the next, my friends?” he murmured. “Let’s have
another drink. I need just one more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time another drink was brought. It was
strange to note the effect of the stuff on those youths.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Ditson and Lynch became flushed and excited, talking
with a sort of reckless and fictitious hilarity. Du Boise,
calm, placid, smiling, lay back in his chair and watched
them as if studying them sympathetically, graciously,
almost pityingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, here,” said Duncan, shaking an uplifted
finger, “we’ve got to stick together on this business.
Of course it was an accident, for we didn’t think either
of those fellows would be drowned when we ran them
down. There’s only one way to protect ourselves, and
that is to swear that neither one of us saw the boat
until there was no chance to avoid hitting it. I feel
like the devil about this business. To tell you the
truth, I feel like what Buckhart called me—a murderer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk that way!” growled Lynch, shrugging
his thick shoulders. “I don’t like it. Even if I didn’t
have any love for Merriwell, I wouldn’t want to kill
him, would I? We’re going to have lots of trouble
over this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Du Boise smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry, my friends,” he said. “Nothing really
matters, anyhow. This life is of no consequence. Perhaps
Merriwell is better off this minute than he would
be if he were living. Perhaps he’s thankful for what
happened. I’m sure the dead are better off than the
living. Why should he haunt us? We were foolish
to fancy we could feel him following us through the
streets to-night. And even if he were following us, he
could do us no harm. The spirits of the departed
cannot harm the living. Why, I wouldn’t be afraid
this minute to stand face to face with Merriwell’s
ghost. If such a thing happened, I would greet the
spirit pleasantly and without the least emotion of terror
or dread.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The blazes you would!” growled Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“You’d be scared to death,” asserted Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I had power to summon the spirit of Merriwell,”
said Du Boise. “I would show you how mistaken
you are. If by a mere incantation I could bring
his wraith before us, I’d joyfully do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Barely were these words spoken when suddenly the
electric lights in the room went out, plunging the place
into deep darkness. This was rather startling and
caused the trio to utter exclamations of surprise.
Apparently the electric current had been suddenly
turned off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch made a move to rise from the table. Ere
he could do this the lights began to glow dimly, illuminating
the room with a faint radiance that gradually
grew stronger.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sudden scream burst from the lips of Hal Du
Boise. Flinging up his hand, he pointed toward the
panel in the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look!” he cried chokingly. “Great heavens, look!
There it is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The panel had been silently opened, and through
that opening the trio could see the deathly white face
of Dick Merriwell, whose dark, staring eyes were fixed
upon them with an accusing gaze that made their very
souls seem to shrivel within them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h2 id='XXXVI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>A TERRIFIED TRIO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Duncan Ditson tried to speak, but his dry tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth and his heart seemed
on the point of bursting in his throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch, having turned to look over his shoulder, sat
like an image of stone, the color slipping from his
usually ruddy face and leaving it almost as ghostly as
that dead-white face seen beyond the open panel. One
of Mike’s hands lay half-closed upon the table. It
began to shake, causing his finger nails to rattle upon
the uncovered top of the table like the faint far-away
tapping of castanets.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the lips of Du Boise, who had lately boasted
that he would feel no terror were he brought face to
face with the wraith of Dick Merriwell, there issued
a sibilant hissing breath followed by a quavering
whisper:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the dead! It’s Merriwell’s ghost! We are
haunted—haunted!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a thud as he slipped from the chair on
which he had been sitting and fell limp and fainting
upon the floor. The lights came on with full force.
An unseen hand closed the sliding panel, hiding that
death-white face from the staring eyes of Lynch and
Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still those two frightened fellows sat immovable,
their bodies cold as ice for some moments after the
apparition vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson was the one who broke the spell. Grasping
the edge of the table, he rose to his feet, upsetting his
chair, which fell with a clatter upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lynch,” he whispered hoarsely; “Lynch, for
Heaven’s sake tell me what you saw!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Mike gave himself a little shake and turned his horrified
eyes toward his companion. His face was
ashen, and there was a purple ring around his mouth.
At the corners of his nose, extending downward, were
two deep lines. His voice was husky and unsteady as
he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what I saw, but it looked like the
dead face of——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused, apparently unable to speak Merriwell’s
name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I saw it, too!” groaned Duncan. “So did Du
Boise. He’s fainted, Mike. We must call assistance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture, however, Hal began to show symptoms
of reviving. He gasped and moaned, moving
his limbs weakly. Ditson stooped and bent over him,
seizing his collar and breaking it loose with a twisting
jerk. The touch of Duncan’s hand seemed to revive
Hal, but apparently it filled the fellow with unspeakable
terror, for he shrank away, choking forth
a cry and beginning to quiver violently in every limb.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, don’t you ring a bell, Lynch?” said Duncan.
“Du Boise is having a fit. He may be dying for all
I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Lynch, leaning forward with his elbows on the
table, had covered his face with his hands as if seeking
in that manner to shut out a terrible vision which
he could not otherwise dismiss. There was a strange
stooping slouch to his broad, thick shoulders—a droop
throughout his entire figure like that which assails an
old man or a younger one who has felt the crushing
hand of some fearful calamity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his legs beneath the table, Du Boise began to
mutter and mumble incoherently. Although he seemed
suffering from terror, he finally fell to laughing in a
hysterical manner, whereupon Duncan once more
clutched him by the shoulder and gave him a shake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Stop it! stop it!” commanded Ditson. “Are you
losing your senses? Get up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t! don’t! don’t!” gasped Hal, shrinking away.
“I’m all right. I’ll be all right in a minute. Did I
faint? I’m a fool! That’s right, Ditson, give me a
hand. Help me up. Oh, how ridiculous! Oh, what
a fool I am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the moment he was lifted he turned his eyes
fearsomely toward the panel in the wall. On seeing it
closed he seemed inexpressibly relieved. With Duncan’s
aid he regained his seat at the table, although he
still seemed dizzy and weak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never did that before in all my life,” he whispered
apologetically. “Wasn’t it a silly trick? Don’t
laugh at me—don’t laugh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not laughing, Du Boise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon if I frightened you by yelling
the way I did. I thought I saw something. Of course
I know I was deceived. It must have been a hallucination.
Perhaps it was the effect of what I’ve drank.
Perhaps the absinthe is beginning to go back on me.
If it is, what can I turn to next? What’s the matter
with Mike?”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment all three were given another frightful
start, for the panel was shot back with a rattling
sound, causing them to turn with a jerk and face it.
The face of the waiter who had served their drinks
appeared at the opening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter in there?” he inquired.
“T’ought I heard somebody give a yelp. T’ought I
heard somet’ing bump on the floor. Didn’t know but
youse chaps was havin’ a mix-up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, Martie, come in here a minute,” invited Duncan,
quickly rising and unfastening the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter stepped into the room, still wearing a
suspicious air as he eyed the pale-faced trio.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Anyt’ing wrong?” he interrogated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess not,” answered Duncan slowly. “You see
we were talking over private matters, and so we fastened
the door. We didn’t want any one to come in
on us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dat’s all right. We know youse fellers here, and
if yer want ter use dis room dat way when dere’s no
game nor nuttin’ goin’ on, dere’s no objection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t wish any one to overhear what we had
to say. While we were talking somebody sneaked up
there and slid open the panel. They must have turned
off the lights, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turned off der lights?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. The lights went out and then came on again,
although they were dim at first. There’s a switch outside
the door, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure t’ing, dere’s a switch out dere, but I don’t
see who it was dat monkeyed wit’ it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you encounter any one on the stairs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any fellows in the other room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dey just went out about five minutes ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you know Dick Merriwell by sight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I t’ink I do. Everybody knows him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has he been in the place to-night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He don’t come around this place much of any unless
he’s lookin’ for some of his friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you seen him to-night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where were you when you thought you heard a
scream and a fall in this room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was out back tappin’ a barrel of ale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you came upstairs at once?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon as I could. ’Twan’t more dan a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that was time enough for an eavesdropper to
slip downstairs without being caught by you. Somebody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>was listening there at the panel. We all saw
the person. That’s why we raised a rumpus. There’s
no trouble between us, Martie. Everything’s all right.
But if you catch anybody listening around that slide,
jump on ’em and kick them downstairs. Bring us
another round of drinks. I reckon we need them. I’ll
have the same, and Lynch will, too. You’d better
switch off that stuff you’re drinking, Du Boise. It isn’t
good for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t switch now,” said Hal. “Just one more, Martie.
It’ll be my last to-night. Just one more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the waiter had disappeared and the door was
fastened behind him Ditson came back and stood by
the table, looking inquiringly at his two companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of it?” he finally forced
himself to inquire, ineffectually trying to assume an
air of nonchalance. “It certainly looked like the real
thing to me, and it scared Du Boise out of his senses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you saw something, did you?” whispered Hal.
“Tell me what it was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought I saw a face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know I saw a face,” said Lynch. “Fellows, we’re
haunted! This is the first time I’ve ever acknowledged
a belief in ghosts, but I’ve got to acknowledge it now.
The face I saw was that of Merriwell, and we know
he is lying at the bottom of the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk that way—don’t!” implored Du Boise.
“It was a hallucination. It could have been nothing
else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does it happen that we were all deceived by
the same hallucination?” questioned Ditson. “There’s
something you can’t explain, Hal. You saw it first
and uttered a yell. We turned and looked. I confess
that I saw it as distinctly as I ever saw anything
in my life. It was ghastly pale with wide-open eyes
which struck terror to my heart. By Jove! I got such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>a start that I’m afraid I’ll never have any more nerve.
I wish Martie would hurry up with those drinks. I’m
still cold from my head to my heels.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the relief of the agitated trio of rascals, Martie
now appeared with a tray that bore the ordered drinks.
Ditson relieved the waiter, handing out the money supplied
by Du Boise. When Martie had vanished and
they were again sitting around the table, Duncan lifted
his glass with a quivering hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s hoping we’ve seen it for the last time,” he
muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the last time,” echoed Lynch hoarsely. “I hope
so, but I fear it’s only the beginning.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>
  <h2 id='XXXVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>PANGS  OF  CONSCIENCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having sipped a little of the absinthe, Du Boise began
to smile in a silly, satisfied manner. He surveyed
his companions with a superior air of knowledge, in
which there was unmistakable pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The psychology of the mind is a mysterious and
perplexing thing,” he observed. “As yet the phenomena
of mental telepathy is but faintly understood.
Like electricity, we know it exists and we experiment
with it, but the real vital force and power is beyond
the comprehension of the human mind in its present
state of development. I think, gentlemen, we have this
evening experienced a most remarkable case of mental
suggestion. I think we all have been deluded by our
own overwrought imaginations. There is no other
reasonable explanation which we, as sane and sensible
men, can afford to accept.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch gazed at him blankly, while Ditson sharply
demanded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you driving at now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I may not succeed in arousing your comprehension.
Perhaps you may not agree with me if
you do catch my theory and fully comprehend its significance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come down to earth and talk plain English.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I acknowledge that I was frightened by what I
fancied I saw,” said Hal, “but I’ve put that aside. I’m
no longer alarmed in the least. I now believe beyond
question that I was deluded by a hallucination conjured
before my mental vision by my own unwitting
efforts. I was in precisely the proper psychological
condition to deceive myself into believing that I saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>something which did not exist. We had been talking
of supernatural things. This, following the unfortunate
tragedy which we lately witnessed, was enough
to place us all in a mental condition that made us peculiarly
susceptible to a certain delusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were speaking of ghosts. We had fancied while
walking on the street that something was following us,
although we could discover nothing when we looked
round. I assure you that I was sincere when I stated
a willingness to conjure up the spirit of Dick Merriwell.
At that moment I longed for the ability to bring
his ghost before me. I even fancied it as appearing.
With this powerful fancy overcoming me, I lifted my
eyes and looked toward yonder panel. The lights were
turned off at that moment. As they came on dimly
my overwrought fancy made me believe I beheld the
pale and ghostly face of Merriwell peering in upon us.
It was nothing in the world but a hallucination.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That might be true were it not for the fact that
Lynch and myself beheld the same white, ghostly
face,” said Ditson. “I’d like to think you have hit on
the real explanation of the affair, Du Boise, but I
can’t accept it. Had you been the only one to see that
apparition, your explanation would be received by us
both; but how can you account for the fact that we
also saw what you believed you saw—and we saw it
at precisely the same time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Telepathy,” said Du Boise, nodding his head.
“Mental transmission of thought. Did I not cry out
that I saw it as I pointed toward the panel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so. Being thus firmly convinced that I
really beheld such an apparition, I transferred the conviction
to both of you, and you, too, were deluded into
believing you saw it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Dunc shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“That’s too much for me to accept,” he said. “It’s
barely possible such a thing might have happened between
two persons, but when three individuals are involved,
it’s wholly beyond acceptance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harold shrugged his shoulders and sipped a little
more of the cool absinthe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I cannot compel you to accept my explanation,”
he said, “but I am certain you will come
to it in time. At present you are both overcome by
unreasoning fears. As time passes and you are not
again visited by such an apparition you will gradually
be forced to confess that my explanation of this
strange phenomenon is the only one that can be given.
You still remain frightened, both of you. Lynch looks
ten years older than he did three hours ago. Your
nerves are quivering in your bodies. Look—look at
my hand, it’s steady as a rock.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lifted his glass and held it unquivering above
the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s not you,” said Duncan. “You couldn’t do
that yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The absinthe. Only for the stuff you’ve drank,
you’d be a pitiful, cowering, cringing creature this very
minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then here’s to absinthe!” laughed Hal, with a wave
of his glass. “Here’s to absinthe, the magic potion
which makes every man the commander of his own
soul!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Until the cursed stuff takes command and wrecks
both soul and body,” said Ditson. “I fear that time
is not far away for you, Du Boise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch now filled his lungs with a deep breath, betraying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>a sudden restlessness and an eager desire to
leave the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s get out of here,” he urged. “I’m going to
my room. I’m going to turn in. It’s a wonder we
haven’t had newspaper reporters after us already. Of
course by this time they all know of Merriwell’s
drowning. We’ll have to tell the story until we’re
sick of it in the morning. We’ll have to face both
reporters and police. I’ve got to rest in order to do
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rest?” said Duncan. “I hope you can. I’m afraid
I shall get very little rest to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor was Lynch to experience any genuine refreshing
rest. In his room, with the door locked, he paced the
floor for hours, pausing at intervals to listen, with
shuddering heart, to every faint sound of the night.
His face was drawn and lined like a graven mask.
His eyes rolled restlessly in their sockets. The passing
footsteps of a night watchman caused him to stand
with quivering hand pressed to his bosom, his jaw
drooping, his breath suspended, waiting, waiting—for
what?</p>

<p class='c007'>He had closed his window and drawn the shade so
that not even a crack remained at the bottom. Even
though every light in the room was at full blast, he
whirled now and then to peer nervously into the corners
and behind the morris chair. The sudden scampering
of a mouse somewhere in the wall dropped him
nerveless upon the couch, where he sat mopping the
beads of cold perspiration from his face. Once as he
walked the length of the room he caught a glimpse
of a phantomlike figure which gave him a sidelong
leap and brought a gasping “Ah!” from his lips. Half
crouching and staring across his shoulder, he realized
that the thing he had seen was his own reflection in
a mirror.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Fool! fool!” he huskily whispered. “Why don’t
you go to bed? Are you trying to wear your own
nerves to a frazzle? What a coward you are, Mike
Lynch! If your friends knew, they’d be disgusted
with you. You didn’t mean to drown the poor devil
when you suggested that Berger should run down that
cockle shell of a rowboat. It was an accident—I say
it was an accident. You can’t make anything else of
it. No one can make anything else of it. Even if they
prove we smashed the boat intentionally, we can swear
we meant it for a joke. What if they do say it was
a crazy, foolhardy joke? We’ll stick to it that there
was no malice in it. That ought to save us. Perhaps
we may have to leave college, but I don’t see how anything
worse is going to happen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Merriwell’s friends will know it was not meant
for a joke. They’ll swear it was malicious. They’ll
swear it isn’t the first time I’ve tried to injure him.
The fact that there was bad blood between us is going
to make it rather unpleasant for me. But I’m not
alone in this. Ditson is as deep in the mud as I am in
the mire. Du Boise—I’m sorry we had him with us.
He’s the fellow I fear. Unsupported by either drink
or drug, Du Boise is a shivering, weak-kneed, spineless
creature. There’s no reliance to be placed upon
him. But I don’t believe even he is fool enough to
think we intended to drown Merriwell. I’m going to
bed now. I’ve got to go to bed. Why, I’ll be a wreck
in the morning if I don’t get a little sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no sleep for Mike. He dared not
turn off his lights, and when he attempted to woo
slumber with them blazing at full blast he soon found
his efforts vain. Groaning and cursing, he tossed to
and fro upon the bed. Gradually the ticking of his
little clock beat in his ears louder and louder until it
sounded like hammer-strokes upon an anvil. Whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>he closed his eyes a ghastly white face seemed to rise
before him, and he fancied he beheld an outstretched
accusing finger pointing at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally in despair he rose, drew his bathrobe about
him, and sat down near the study table. Seizing a
novel, he tried to read. The sentences ran into a
meaningless jumble before his eyes, and his tortured
mind continued to wander to the thing he longed to
forget. Repeatedly he started up and turned to look
behind him, shuddering and cold with the conviction
that some ghostly thing was hovering at the back of
his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>And thus the long night passed. Between three and
four o’clock in the morning Lynch opened his window
and waited for dawn. He joyously hailed the first
faint streaks of gray in the eastern sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s morning,” he said. “Now perhaps I can
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But no, even daylight could not bring him rest. The
sun was tinting the east with a delicate blush when
Mike slipped downstairs and hurried away, filling his
lungs with long, deep breaths. The streets were silent
and deserted. Not even a policeman seemed stirring
at this hour, for which he was sincerely thankful.
Without knowing whither he was bound, he turned
his face toward the outskirts of the city and with long
strides made for the open country.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour later Lynch was lying exhausted by the
roadside in the midst of a strip of woods. All around
him the young day was fresh and beautiful and joyous.
In the thickets the birds were singing happily. The
air was clean and sweet with the fragrance of springtime.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike had been there before. He remembered the
very cluster of bushes beside which he now lay. At
one time, with two companions, he had hidden himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>there to await the appearance of Rob Claxton, against
whom he entertained a feeling of hatred and whom
he was determined to thrash in a fist fight. With some
bitterness he recalled the fact that Claxton had whipped
him in that fight which took place not far from this
spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Merriwell was responsible for it!” he snarled.
“For a long time he had been secretly training that
haughty Virginian in order that the fellow might do
me up in a scrap. No wonder I hated Merriwell! I
had good reasons to hate him! I had good reasons
to wish him dead! I’m a fool to be upset like this!
I’m a fool to run away from investigation and questioning!
Wait, after I’ve rested a while I’m going
back. Never anything took hold of me the way this
business has. On my word, I’m done up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He rolled over upon his back and lay there, with his
hat covering his eyes, until a faint far-away sound led
him to lift his head and listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Runners!” he said. “They’re coming this way.
Great Scott! are they after me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jerking himself to his feet, he cautiously peered over
the cluster of bushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Far along the road where it wound through the
woods some lightly clad figures came into view. His
relief was intense, for he saw at a glance that they were
college lads out for an early morning run. Their
white clothes, swinging bare arms, and churning legs
cut moving silhouettes against the dark background
of the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mustn’t be seen,” muttered Lynch, sinking down
and creeping close behind the bushes. “I’ll lie here
and watch them as they pass. They won’t notice me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The runners were Mike’s classmates. First came
Claxton, the Virginian, and Sam Kates almost shoulder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>to shoulder. A short distance behind them Brad
Buckhart appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came another, at sight of whom Lynch uttered
a hoarse, choking cry, sought to rise and then
fell back, his head swimming, his senses deserting him,
completely overcome by the fearful strain and the second
appearance of the “apparition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For he had again seen Dick Merriwell.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>
  <h2 id='XXXVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick heard a cry and caught a glimpse of the figure
which dropped back behind the bushes. Shouting to
his companions, he whirled to the roadside and knelt
over Lynch, whom he found stretched unconscious
upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mike revived he found them working over
him, and the boy he had so bitterly hated, the boy he
had fancied dead, was one of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take him away! take him away!” cried Lynch,
struggling weakly and staring at Dick with unutterable
horror. “He’s dead! Don’t let him touch me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He means you, partner,” said Buckhart. “I sure
reckon he’s some disturbed to see you alive and
kicking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s dead!” groaned Mike. “I killed him, but I
didn’t mean to do it. I wanted to run him down and
let him swim for it. That’s all. I didn’t think he
would drown, but I killed him, and I’m a murderer!
There, I’ve confessed it now! You all hear me—I’ve
confessed it! I killed him! Hang me! I suppose
they will. Don’t let him look at me like that. Take
him away—please take him away! Don’t look at me,
Merriwell! I can’t bear those eyes. I felt you following
at my heels last night. I saw you when you appeared
to us at Fred’s. Even after I locked myself
in my own room I knew you were near. I couldn’t
stand it long. It was too much for me. You’ve forced
me to confess at last. You’ve made me put my neck
in a noose. Now you should be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In vain they had tried to check his panting flow of
words, but now Dick managed to make his voice heard,
speaking quietly and soothingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“I’m no ghost, Lynch. I’m here in the flesh. You
didn’t drown me. I’m glad to know that you didn’t
really try to drown me. I couldn’t think that of you,
revengeful as I know you to be. Look here, touch my
hand and satisfy yourself that I’m living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But when he held out his hand to Lynch the fellow
writhed and squirmed and rolled away, shrieking with
fear until his lips were covered with froth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great horn spoon!” muttered the Texan. “That
gent is pretty near daffy, partner. Never expected to
see him go to pieces like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep him away from me!” shrieked Mike. “Don’t
let him touch me! Let me go! Help me to my feet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was with the utmost difficulty that they prevented
him from rising and taking flight. Indeed he did get
upon his feet and stagger out to the road, fighting
them all off as they sought to assist him.</p>

<p class='c007'>A farm wagon, bound for town, came along, drawn
by two scraggy horses. On the seat sat a bewhiskered
old fellow who regarded the boys with no small
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey!” he called, pulling up the horses. “What’s
the matter with that fellow, anyhaow? Goshfry
mighty, he acts as if he was purty nigh crazy! Guess
he must have been hittin’ up somebody’s hard cider,
hey? Jerusalem! but they do git an awful jag when
they fill up on cider. I know haow it is, for I’ve been
there myself. The gosh-derned stuff makes ye act like
all thutteration. What’s he sayin’ a-yappin’ about
spooks and dead folks and things like that? By gum!
I guess you fellers better take keer of him. Be you
his friends? Waal, you better git him to a doctor jest
as soon as you ken. Put him in my waggin? ’Course
you ken. Jest ketch right holt and h’ist him aboard.
Couple of ye better come along with him to keep him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>quiet. I’ll only charge ye twenty-five cents apiece to
take you clean into the city, and that’s cheap enough,
by gum!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Lynch was tossed aboard the old farm wagon,
and two of the boys clambered in after him. Not until
the strip of woods was left far behind did Mike quiet
down and become amenable to reason. Even then
when they attempted to explain he grew violent and
shriekingly forbade them to mention Merriwell’s name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brad Buckhart remained with Dick and the others
who decided to complete the morning run ere retracing
their steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partner,” said the Texan, as they were again jogging
along the road, “I sure reckon you have accomplished
your object with that gent. He’s just about
as near bughouse as any galoot I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” agreed Dick, “I think he has been properly
punished. I’m willing to let up on him now, and I
hope he comes out without going clean daffy.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c007'>A moment before the sharp prow of the steam launch
struck Buckhart’s <i>Sallie</i>, Dick realized the collision
could not be averted, rose to his feet, and made a headlong
dive into the water. His action was not seen by
Buckhart, whose eyes were fastened on the launch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Understanding the danger of being hit by the whirling
propeller of the launch, Merriwell dove as deep as
possible. With powerful strokes he swam some distance
beneath the water. When compelled to rise to
the surface, he turned his head and found that the
launch had passed over him and was some distance
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>He wondered what had become of Brad and looked
around in vain for some sign of his companion. Near
at hand swung a vessel at anchor. Toward this Dick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>swam, reaching its side and seizing a hawser which
dangled to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he clung there in the deep shadow of the vessel
he discovered that the launch had slackened its speed
and was swinging round on its course. Across the
intervening water came the sound of excited voices.
Brad Buckhart was hotly denouncing the fellows who
had cut down the rowboat.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great wave of relief swept over Dick, for he knew
now that in some manner the Texan had escaped and
was on board the launch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick’s first inclination was to raise a shout and announce
that he also was safe and unharmed. This was
suppressed almost instantly by a desire to wait and
see what would happen, and so, clinging to the hawser
there in the dark shadow of the vessel with only his
head above the surface of the water, the boy watched
and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like Brad, Merriwell believed the rowboat had been
cut down by deliberate intent. On discovering that
Lynch and Ditson were aboard the launch, this belief
became a fixed certainty in Dick’s mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The launch slid slowly past, with Buckhart vainly
straining his eyes for some glimpse of his chum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s awfully tough on Brad,” thought Dick; “but
I’m more than willing those other fellows should think
I’ve been drowned. If they have a conscience, it ought
to prick them a little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pulling at the hawser, he found that it was secure,
and when the launch had passed he lost little time in
lifting himself up by the rope, hand over hand, and,
rolling over the rail of the vessel, dropped to the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the vessel Dick watched the launch as the
afterglow of sunset died in the west, and night spread
its sable wings above the world. He saw other boats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>join in the search, but still he declined to make known
the fact that he had escaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>A huge colored man, stretching his arms, and yawning,
appeared on deck from below.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mah golly!” he muttered. “Ah must hab slept like
a log. Why, it’s gone got dark areddy, and Ah ain’t
lit dem lights. If de cap’n evah foun’ dat out, Ah’d
ketch it. Ah guess Ah’ll hurry up about gittin’ dem
lights lit. Yes, sah!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, Sambo,” said Dick, in a low tone, as
he stepped out and confronted the negro. “You better
get onto your job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fo’ laws sake!” gasped the colored man, starting
back. “Where yo’ come from, maan? How’d yo’
git on dis yere vessel? What yo’ doin’ on dis yere
vessel? By golly! Ah guess yo’ one ob dem pirate
thieves dat goes round stealin’ from vessels, ain’t yer?
Now, yo’ keep yo’ distance. Don’ come near dis nigger,
fo’ Ah’ll crack your skull jes’ as sure’s yo’ do.
Ah’s a baad maan, Ah is. Mah name is Thomas Jefferson
Jackson Jones, and Ah’s dangerous when Ah
gits mah mad up. If Ah eber hits yo’ wif one of
dese mauls ob mine, dat will be yo’ funeral, maan.
Yo’ll ride along wif de flowers in de front carriage,
and yo’ won’t hear none of de music. Yes, sir; yes,
sir! Ah’s dangerous!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look it,” laughed Dick, for through the darkness
he could see the darky’s eyes rolling with terror,
and it seemed that the fellow’s shaking knees
would melt beneath him. “Don’t let my accidental
presence on board the vessel disturb you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Ah’s not disturbed in the slightes’ declivity,”
hastily retorted Thomas Jefferson Jackson Jones.
“Ah’s puffeckly caam and placated, Ah is. Ah’s a maan
dat nebber takes no chances. Always carries a razzor
in mah pocket for ’mergencies. Yes, sah!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Well, let your razor stay in your pocket,” said
Dick. “You won’t have to use it. Be kind enough to
do me a favor—don’t speak quite so loud. I’ll explain
how you came to find me here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The darky listened with an air of doubt to Dick’s
words, but the boy called his attention to the fact that
the launch and a number of small boats were moving
about near the spot where the collision had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re still searching for me,” said Merriwell.
“For certain reasons I don’t want them to know I
escaped. I want them to think I was drowned. Now,
Sambo, I’m going to make you a proposition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah beliebe Ah ’stinctly tol’ you mah name is
Thomas Jefferson Jackson Jones. Yo’ll kindly deflane
from callin’ me Sambo, sah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Thomas,” laughed Dick. “I see you’re
very sensitive. I have no desire to hurt your tender
feelings. Instead of that, I feel very friendly toward
you. After you have lighted those lamps you can
make five dollars by taking a boat and setting me
ashore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah ain’t s’posed to leabe dis vessel, sah,” said the
colored man, “but if Ah saw a five-dollar bill a-comin’
mah way, Ah might be injewsed to leave it fo’ a
short time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy brought out some money, and finally succeeded
in peeling a dripping five-dollar bill from the
small roll.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the real stuff, Thomas,” he said. “If you give
me your word that you’ll set me ashore, and say nothing
about it, the money is yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mah word is jes’ as good as mah bond,” chuckled
the negro, “and dey ain’t either one wuth a tinker’s
rap. Yah! yah! yah! But when Ah see a five-dollar
William comin’ mah way, Ah’s ready fo’ almos’ anything.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Yo’ hol’ up, maan, till Ah gets dem lamps
lighted. Ah’ll be wif yer in jes’ about two seconds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Made secure by a painter, a boat lay floating under
the stern of the vessel. When the colored man had set
the lamp he returned and drew this boat up on the
port side of the vessel and dropped into it along with
Merriwell. It was now dark, so Dick was not recognized
by any of the searchers, and therefore his plan
of deception was carried through successfully.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“’St, Brad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan stopped in his tracks as a dark figure
stepped out before him. Brad had just left the pier,
having told Lynch, Ditson, and Du Boise what he
thought of them and what he meant to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>A queer, quivery sensation shot along Buckhart’s
spine. He stood quite still and stared at the dark
figure which promptly strode toward him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t raise a shout, old man,” said the voice of
Dick Merriwell. “Don’t let those fellows hear you.
It is I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Brad deliberately pinched himself to make sure he
was awake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds like you, and it looks like you,” he said,
“but it can’t be you. You’re drowned!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly,” said Merriwell, as he dropped a hand on
the shoulder of his chum. “But I want those fellows
still to think I’m drowned. I’m in hopes it will worry
them some. That’s why I didn’t let you know I hadn’t
gone to the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Realizing at last that Merriwell was there in the
flesh, the Texan suddenly caught Dick’s wet figure in
his arms and gave him a bear hug.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, great horn spoon, I’ve got to yell!” he panted.
“If I don’t, I’ll sure blow up. Say, partner, can’t I
yell just once? Can’t I let off steam a little? Gophers
and jack rabbits, I thought you were dead! Oh, say,
what a funny feeling I’ve got! I don’t know how
to express it. Hang it all, didn’t you know I was
searching for you with the rest of the bunch? Didn’t
you realize how I felt about it? Partner, I wouldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>go through that thing again for fifty thousand dollars!
I sure reckoned you were food for the fishes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texan’s voice was quivering with emotion, and
he trembled in every limb.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was rough on you,” agreed Dick, “and perhaps
I’m mistaken in thinking it will disturb those rascals
to fancy me done for. Let’s wait here until they pass.
We can tell by what they are saying whether they are
disturbed or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hidden in the narrow space between two of the old
buildings, the boys waited until the trio of rascals
came along and passed on their way. Falling in behind
but taking pains not to be seen, Dick and Brad
followed the three to the first saloon and from thence
to Fred’s place of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve taken a private room,” said Brad, after
peering between the swinging doors. “They’ve gone
upstairs, partner. I reckon they intend to drown their
remorse with plenty of booze. If you should appear
before them now, they’d certain think you a spook.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick laughed softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a fancy to play the spook,” he said. “Come
with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a near-by restaurant he purchased a few cents’
worth of flour, which was given him in a paper bag.
Slipping this into his pocket, he led the way back to
Fred’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a very few patrons in Fred’s as the boys
entered. Spofford, a sophomore, was leaning lurchingly
on the bar and telling a story. Two or three of
Spofford’s chums were with him. The barkeeper was
listening and the waiter was opening a barrel in the
back room. No one paid any attention to Dick and
Brad, who sauntered through and quietly ascended the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two rooms above. Listening, Merriwell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>soon learned which of these was occupied by the fellows
he hoped to frighten. Having located them, he
brought forth the bag of flour, which he proceeded to
smear over his face until his features were well coated
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I look rather ghostly, Brad?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your face looks that way,” softly chuckled the
Texan, “but there’s nothing very ghostly about the rest
of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I’ll show only my face,” decided Dick.
“Here’s the panel through which drinks are passed
into that room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They shouldn’t see you in too strong a light,” murmured
Brad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell’s fingers found the switch and turned it.
This cut off all the lights in the upper part of the
building.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s too much,” he whispered quickly. “Turn
off that one over your head, Brad. Hurry up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a faint click, and the Texan announced
that he had found the electric bulb and turned off the
current. Then Dick softly pushed back the panel and
manipulated the electrical switch. He did not turn it
on at once, but moved it gradually, getting the result
hoped for as the lights glowed dimly at first.</p>

<p class='c007'>The startled fellows within that room saw the
white, ghastly face at the open panel and Du Boise
shrieked and fell to the floor in a faint. Dick closed
the panel at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Skip, Brad!” he hissed. “We must make a sudden
duck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Spofford and his friends had left, and only the barkeeper
was found in the lower room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that yell I heard?” he asked, as the boys
appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing but a little practical joke,” said Dick, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>he mopped the flour from his face with his handkerchief.
“Those fellows upstairs are hitting the booze
too hard. It’s time they swore off. They may think
they’ve seen a ghost. Perhaps you’ll help them reform
if you fail to undeceive them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t say a word,” said Brad, tossing a silver dollar
on the bar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You sure gave those gents something of a start,
partner,” said Brad, as they hurried away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I did,” agreed Merriwell. “You should
have seen them, Brad. Their eyes stuck out of their
heads. Du Boise collapsed like a pricked bladder. It
was really amusing. I’ve been well paid for the ducking
I received.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you have!” growled the Texan. “But
I’ve got a bill to settle with those gents. They still
have to pay me for my <i>Sallie</i>, and you bet your life
I’ll make them cough up. You hear me gently chirp!”</p>

  <h2 id='XL' class='c005'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <span class='large'>A QUEER DELUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mike Lynch was placed under the care of a doctor,
who found it necessary to give the fellow opiates in
order to quiet him. The doctor fancied Lynch would
come around all right in case he could get some sleep,
which he seemed to require. Mike’s friends took turns
in watching him through the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward nightfall Lynch awoke and discovered Ditson
and Wolfe in the room. He announced his intention
of getting up and proceeded to do so in spite of
their remonstrances.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m all right,” he declared. “The trouble with me
was that I couldn’t seem to sleep after the unfortunate
drowning of Merriwell last night. I’ve been troubled
with hallucinations I suppose. Never had anything
like that before. I’m nearly starved, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think you would be,” said Ditson, exchanging
glances with Wolfe. “Come on with us and
get something to eat. You know we all thought Merriwell
drowned, and even now I don’t know how he
escaped. Of course we’re glad he did escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you talking about?” cried Lynch, beginning
to show excitement. “Merriwell’s dead. Don’t
think you can soothe my feelings by giving me the impression
that he escaped. Don’t try to deceive me,
Ditson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now listen to reason, Mike,” urged Duncan.
“Here’s Bern—he’ll tell you that Merriwell’s all right.
We’ve both seen him several times to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But at this Lynch fell into such a state of excitement
that both his friends were startled and alarmed. He
beat the air with his clenched fists and cried out that
Merriwell was dead and would have to remain so.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“By Jove!” whispered Wolfe, in Ditson’s ear.
“We’d better let up on this. The only way to satisfy
him is to show him Merriwell alive and in good
health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that may not satisfy him,” murmured Dunc.
“They say the thing that threw him into a fit was the
sight of Merriwell this morning. Mike’s the last person
I’d ever fancied would get this way. I didn’t
suppose he had any nerves. He’s literally gone to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They soothed him by changing the subject of their
conversation. By the time he was dressed and ready
to go out he again seemed in his normal condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>On their way to a restaurant they met Merriwell,
who, with several friends, was coming from the gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c007'>At sight of Dick, Lynch turned ghastly pale and
trembled. Not a word came from his lips, but he
turned his head away and walked on with averted eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell is looking pretty healthy for a dead
man,” observed Wolfe, winking at Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” cried Mike, with a snarl. “Don’t try any
more of that! I won’t have it. I know he’s dead, and
that ends it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His companions looked at each other in wonderment,
deciding that, although Lynch seemingly had recovered,
he was a subject for the care of a physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even the doctor who attended Lynch could not
quite understand the condition of the fellow’s mind.
In everything else Mike seemed rational, but the mere
mentioning of Merriwell’s name in his hearing threw
him into a state of excitement that bordered on frenzy.
At sight of Dick, whom he occasionally encountered,
he invariably turned pale and averted his eyes. Some
of the fellow’s friends insisted that he ought to go
home and take a rest, but this caused Lynch to grin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and declare that he was in “the finest condition ever.”
He simply refused to acknowledge that Dick Merriwell
was not dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson and Du Boise raised money to settle for Brad
Buckhart’s boat and felt that they were getting out
of the affair very cheaply. Of course Dick was told
of Mike Lynch’s singular mental delusion, but he, like
nearly every one else, believed Lynch would get over
it in time.</p>

<p class='c007'>These were busy days for Dick. Baseball absorbed
nearly all his spare time. He was not a little surprised
when Wilbur Keene came to him and asked to
be coached in pitching. At first Dick thought the fellow
joshing, but Keene was in sober earnest, and
therefore day after day Merriwell spent thirty minutes
or more time instructing the varsity pitcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Welch and the rest of the varsity twirlers
learned that Keene was being coached by Dick they
unbottled their scorn upon Wilbur. He was compelled
to endure all sorts of jeers and sneers. Nevertheless,
he persisted, for from the very start he was convinced
that Dick’s tutoring would be beneficial to him.
Within a few days he could see an improvement in
his work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first thing Dick insisted on was that Keene
should persist in obtaining control of the ball. This
he declared was far more essential than speed or
curves. The man who possessed perfect control and
had a good head on his shoulders could often deceive
a batter who could not be deceived by the chap whose
control was imperfect, even though the latter had
everything else that a pitcher needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moment Keene could, put the ball where he
wished to put it Dick began on other things, and from
that time the pupil made rapid progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>In practice on Friday, the day before the scheduled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>game with Cornell, Keene did some pitching for batting
practice. It happened that Dick was present and
on the bench. Wilbur decided to try his newly learned
kinks upon his comrades, and did so with the most
surprising and satisfying results. Safe hits were few
and far between. When hit at all the ball had a nasty
way of popping into the air or rolling punkily along
the ground. To the exasperation of the players, they
could not seem to get their bats squarely against the
ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think of that, Leyden?” inquired
Emery, trotting up to the coach. “Keene seems to be
in pretty good trim to-day, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you know why, don’t you?” said Leyden.
“He’s the only pitcher who has taken the freshman
Merriwell as a coach. The rest are prejudiced against
Merriwell or else they have too much foolish pride.
Keene is certainly improving. You’d better consider
putting him into the box to-morrow. It would be a
good time to try him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welch expects to pitch to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you haven’t told him that he’s to pitch, have
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly. I don’t choose a pitcher so far ahead of
a game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Leyden, “I urge you once more to consider
my suggestion. Keene hasn’t been given much
real work. Start him on the slab to-morrow. If they
pound him, pull him off.”</p>

  <h2 id='XLI' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLI.<br /> <span class='large'>SILVER BULLETS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mike Lynch dropped into an old curio shop and inspected
an old-fashioned powder-and-ball pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will it shoot all right?” inquired Mike, as he
snapped the weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vy, certainly, mine frendt—vy, certainly it vill,”
answered the Jew proprietor. “It vos a goot pistol.
It vos choost as goot as it efer vos. But you don’t
vant it to shoot vid, do you? Most beople buy such
dings as a decorations. Dey put dem up on der vall
to look ad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I want it for,” said Mike; “but, still, I
want to know that the old thing will really shoot. If
it was properly loaded, would it kill anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vy, certainly, mine frendt—certainly. Dot pistol
vent through der Revolutionary Var. Heer vos der
bullet mold dot goes vid it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t say so! Why, I thought they used flintlocks
then. This is a percussion cap pistol. Do you
suppose I could get any caps to fit it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right over at der hardware store,” said the old
Jew. “You vill find plenty of dem, mine frendt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the price of the pistol and mold?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fife tollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give you a dollar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, mine cootness! Do you vant to rob me? I
pay four tollar for dat pistol.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All I have is a dollar,” said Mike, taking out a
bill. “Here it is. Take it or not just as you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cootn’t you make it two tollar?” whined the old
Jew. “I vill lose money on it at dot, but I vant to
get rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Take it or not,” repeated Mike, waving the dollar
bill in front of the shopkeeper’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He got the pistol and left with it in his pocket.
Visiting the hardware store, he secured a box of caps
and a small supply of powder. In the hardware store
Lynch found a tinsmith to whom he made a most
peculiar proposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you see this?” said Mike, producing the bullet
mold. “I want you to mold me a few silver bullets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tinsmith gazed at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silver bullets?” he questioned doubtfully. “Why
aren’t lead bullets good enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want silver bullets,” persisted Mike. “A silver
bullet is the only thing that will destroy a ghost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, young man,” said the tinknocker, “is
there anything the matter with your head, or are you
talking to hear yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike winked gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind,” he said. “You have a nice little
furnace there, and here is a couple of silver dollars.
Can’t you melt that money and mold me some bullets?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s against the law to destroy United States
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But no one besides ourselves will know anything
about it. I’ll give you five dollars to do the job for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five dollars is an inducement. Have you got it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here it is,” said Mike, handing it over. “I’ll pay
you in advance, and I’ll wait for those bullets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When he left he had several fresh-molded silver bullets
in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night, in the privacy of his room, with the door
securely locked, Lynch carefully loaded and capped
the old pistol. Two of the silver bullets were rammed
down on top of the powder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s my only way to get rid of Merriwell’s spook,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>he muttered. “My grandmother used to say that a
silver bullet would always lay a spook. Unless I get
rid of this one it will drive me crazy. I’ll find an opportunity
to do the job to-morrow.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c007'>During the game between Yale and Cornell, Dick
Merriwell sat on the Yale bench. He did so at the
request of Keene, who had been sent in to pitch.
Wilbur believed the presence of the lad who had
coached him would serve to steady his nerves and carry
him through the critical points of the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>Keene astonished and delighted the Yale crowd,
pitching a masterly game from start to finish. Had he
failed in any inning, Yale would have been defeated,
for the score was running close and Cornell had a
team that would not be likely to yield any advantage
it might secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike Lynch sat on the bleachers with several of his
classmates. Having discovered Dick on the Yale bench,
Mike stared at him through inning after inning, paying
very little attention to the conversation of his companions
or the excited cheering of the great crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson nudged Bern Wolfe and called his attention
to Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mighty queer about Mike,” he whispered. “I was
talking with the doctor to-day. He seems to think
Mike has received some severe shock from which he
will not recover unless he gets a counter shock. Just
look at him, Bern. See his eyes. See him glare. Why,
he looks absolutely dangerous to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t right for him to stay in college,” muttered
Wolfe. “He ought to get away and take a rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the seventh inning Lynch rose from his seat and
announced that he was going to leave the field. Although
his friends felt that some one should accompany
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>him, the game was at such an exciting point
that not one of them wished to miss any of it. Therefore
Mike was permitted to depart alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of leaving the field, Lynch descended from
the bleachers, followed the walk round toward the
locker house, and let himself in by the gate onto the
field. He was wearing a light overcoat, although the
day was very warm. Beneath that coat there was a
strange bulge over his hip pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do it now!” he whispered huskily, as his eyes
fell on Dick Merriwell’s back. “I’ll end it right here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>His hand found and gripped the stock of the old
pistol. Swiftly advancing toward the unconscious lad,
Mike produced the weapon and softly cocked it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then a foul tip carromed from the bat of a
Cornell man, came whistling through the air, and
struck Lynch near the temple, dropping him unconscious
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mike opened his eyes he was in the locker
room and Merriwell was the first person he saw. Several
others were there, but Dick was on his knees,
working over Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike caught his breath and lifted a hand to his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What—what happened to me?” he muttered
huskily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were hit by a baseball,” answered Dick. “It
knocked you senseless. It hit you in a bad place, too—close
to the temple.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hit by a baseball!” muttered Lynch. “Knocked me
out, didn’t it? Isn’t it queer, but I seem to have been
dreaming. I seem to remember the queerest things,
but they’re all hazy like the visions of a dream. I
thought you were drowned, Merriwell. I thought we
ran you down in a steam launch, and then it seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>that your ghost was haunting me. What a ridiculous
dream, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ridiculous, indeed,” nodded Dick. “But you see
I’m not drowned, and you realize I can’t be a ghost in
my present material condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I realize that,” said Mike. “Of course I
know there’s no such things as ghosts. What’s that
cheering?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sound of the cheering spectators came to their
ears. Into the room rushed several bronzed, healthy-looking
baseball men all in a hilarious condition of
triumph. One of them espied Dick and cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have your hands full coaching the rest of
our pitchers now, Merriwell! By Jove, Keene pitched
a corking game! And he says you made him fit for
the job! We won, four to three! Hurrah for our
new coach!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rah! rah! rah! New coach! new coach! Merriwell,”
cried another chap, flinging his sweater into
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Congratulations, Merriwell,” said Lynch. “You’re
a winner at anything you attempt. You always come
out on top.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick now coached Keene for the great forthcoming
game with Cornell. When the two teams met, Yale
came out victorious and again Merriwell was hailed as
a hero and the credit for the victory freely given him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, however, the pistol carried by Mike
Lynch on the day he was struck senseless by a foul ball
had been found, and trouble was brewing for Mike.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Wilbur Keene, bronzed, flushed, well satisfied, yet
modest in bearing, entered the locker house, surrounded
by his comrades of the varsity nine, which
had just defeated Cornell in the game for which Merriwell
had coached Keene and which proved to be one
of the closest and most exciting games of the season.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one was congratulating Wilbur and telling
him what a wonderful game he had pitched. Perhaps
it would be more accurate to say nearly every one was
congratulating him. Two of the varsity pitchers,
Pumper Welch and Dudley Towne, had not expressed
themselves. Towne seemed wavering, but Welch wore
a sullen, half-sneering look upon his not unhandsome
face. Hitherto Pumper had been considered the leading
pitcher for Yale, and now he realized that a rival
who might snatch some of these honors from him had
suddenly arisen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You certainly held ’em down in the tight places,
Keene, old man,” cried the tall Scotchman, Greg McGregor,
slapping Wilbur on the shoulder. “You pulled
out of the bad holes in beautiful shape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was control—control that did it,” asserted
Cranch, the catcher. “On my word, Wilbur seemed
able to put that ball precisely where he wanted to put
it. Never caught a fellow with better control in all
my life. And, say, Keene, where did you get that
queer hinkey-dink curve that you use for a strike-out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I got that where I got my control,” answered
Keene. “I’m not too proud to acknowledge that I
owe it all to Merriwell’s coaching. The first thing he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>did was to keep at me about perfect control. Said it
was more important than speed or curves. Said it
was the first thing a pitcher ought to work for. As
for that little hinkey-dink curve, as you call it, I got
that trying to throw Merriwell’s combination ball. I
didn’t get the combination, but I did get a queer little
quirky shoot, which I used in the game to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment Greg McGregor made a lunge
through the crowd and seized a lad who was trying to
slip out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you don’t!” shouted Greg triumphantly. “Hi,
fellows! Here he is! Here’s Merriwell! He was
making a sneak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The freshman was dragged back into the room and
surrounded by the bronzed, bare-armed, laughing
youths.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I take off my hat to you, Merriwell,” said Bill
Leyden, with mocking seriousness. “When it comes
to coaching pitchers, you seem to have me skinned a
mile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leyden was the baseball coach.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi, Merriwell!” cried Ben Carter. “Heard about
the horrible calamity that happened to your class team
this afternoon? It’s simply awful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, the Yale freshmen had been playing Highbridge
High, and, regarding the game as a cinch, the
class of Umpty-ten had sent out a wretchedly small
aggregation of rooters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did they do?” laughed Dick. “Did they win
by a score of about twenty to nothing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hardly that,” returned Carter. “Highbridge ate
’em up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on!” mocked Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’ll have to tell that to some one else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not joshing,” persisted Carter. “That’s the report.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Umpty-ten was trimmed by Highbridge. Horrible
doings. Two pitchers knocked out of the box.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t believe it,” said Dick, the smile slowly disappearing
from his face. “Why, no one regarded
Highbridge as dangerous. Both Jones and Robinson
told me I would not be needed with the team to-day.
That’s how I happened to be here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never can tell,” chuckled Carl Henderson.
“Sometimes these things happen when they’re least expected.
It’s possible you might have saved the game
if you’d been with the team, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it’s possible I might have lost this game if he
had been with his own team,” confessed Wilbur Keene.
“Every time I found myself in a hard hole I got a nod
of encouragement from Merriwell, and it seemed to
stiffen my backbone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, will you hear that blamed fool?” muttered
Welch, in Dud Towne’s ear. “He makes me sick at
the stomach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this keeps up,” said Towne, “Merriwell will have
the credit for winning the game, not Keene.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a fluke, anyhow,” growled Welch. “Keene
never pitched like that before, and I doubt if he ever
will again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was that fellow trying to do who got hit by
the ball in the seventh inning?” inquired Towne.
“How did he happen to be on the field? I know him.
He’s a freshman by the name of Lynch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I suppose he’s one of Merriwell’s chums,” answered
Welch, with scornfully curling lips. “He was
sneaking in to get a word with Merriwell when that
swift foul tip caught him and stretched him out cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is now,” said Dud, jerking his head toward
Lynch. “If I remember right, he’s no friend
of Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why did Merriwell take such an interest in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>him after he got knocked silly? Why did Merriwell
come here and work over the fellow the way he did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he do that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure. I wouldn’t stay on the bench, you know. I
was here, and I saw them lug Lynch in. A doctor
came along, but he wasn’t needed. Merriwell had the
fellow’s shirt torn open at the throat and was chafing
his wrists and moistening his forehead. By the time
the doctor got ready to do something his assistance
wasn’t needed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s like Merriwell. He does those things for
friends and foes alike. Let any one need assistance
and he doesn’t stop to ask whether the person is a
friend or an enemy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haw!” grunted Welch. “He’s a great poser. He’s
always trying to show off. Of course he’s all swelled
up now because he’s been coaching a varsity pitcher.
They wanted me to let him give me points. Think of
that! I’m not taking any coaching from a freshman.
I notice that you didn’t grab at the proposition. Keene
was the only one who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Keene pitched the game to-day and won it,”
interrupted Towne, with a shade of regret in his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any one would think you were sorry that you
didn’t let Merriwell coach you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was too much for Pumper Welch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You make me sick, too!” he said. “Go ahead and
coax Mr. Merriwell to coach you. Perhaps you’ll pan
out a great pitcher under his instructions. Oh, thunder,
what fools some fellows are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this final exclamation, Welch strode disgustedly
away. As soon as possible Dick escaped and made
his way from the field. He was disturbed over the
rumor that Umpty-ten had lost to Highbridge High,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and at the gymnasium he sought for confirmation of
this report. Apparently it was true, for every one who
had heard anything at all about it said the same thing.
As Dick was leaving the gym he encountered Bertie
Lee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Kid,” he called. “What do you know about
the Highbridge game?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only what I’ve heard. I was out to watch the
Cornell game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That report must be a josh,” said Dick. “Highbridge
couldn’t beat Umpty-ten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t seem possible,” said Lee, swinging in at
Dick’s side and stretching his short legs to catch Merriwell’s
stride. “Say, I want to tell you something,
Dick. I saw Lynch when he sneaked in onto the field
to-day and I followed him. I think I was the first fellow
to reach him after the ball stretched him out. Do
you know what made me follow him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t say that I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll tell you. I got a look at his face, and I
knew he was up to some trick. If ever I saw a sneaky,
bloodthirsty mug, it was that of Mike Lynch. You
know I’ve had trouble with him, and I don’t love him
any. I’m scared to death of him now. He’d cut his
grandmother’s throat, that fellow would. Funny nobody
noticed what he had in his hand when he was hit
by the ball.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What he had in his hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did he have in his hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t show you here. I’ve got it. It’s in my
pocket. I picked it up. I want you to have it. You
better find out what Mike Lynch was going to do. He
was sneaking up behind you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve wondered what he was trying to do,” said
Dick. “Lee, you’ve got my curiosity aroused. Come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>on over to the house and show me what it was you
picked up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bertie followed Dick to his room on York Street.
The moment the door was closed behind them Dick
expectantly faced the little fellow, who had once been
prominent in the Ditson set, but who was now practically
ostracized.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m liable to get hurt for this,” said Lee, who now
appeared genuinely alarmed. “Those fellows have
threatened me. They suspect I’ve told you about several
of their sneaking plots and schemes against you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s too late to back out now, Kid,” said Dick.
“You know I won’t betray you. You may as well tell
me the whole business. What was it you picked up on
the field after Mike Lynch was knocked senseless?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bertie unbuttoned his coat and produced something
from beneath it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is what I found,” he announced, handing it
over to Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was an old-fashioned percussion-cap pistol.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h2 id='XLIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SILVER BULLETS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Look out!” exclaimed Bertie; “it’s loaded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick held the queer old pistol in his hand, turning it
slowly and looking at it with a puzzled expression on
his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is mighty queer,” he muttered. “I don’t understand
it. Did you see Lynch with this weapon in
his hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He dropped it when he was knocked out by the
ball,” persisted Bertie. “He was sneaking up behind
you with that pistol, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should Mike Lynch, or any one else for that
matter, carry a weapon like this?” speculated Dick.
“It’s an ancient relic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know Mike has been rotten queer lately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know,” nodded Dick. “He’s been troubled
with hallucinations. Of course, you know about the
running down of Buckhart’s boat in the harbor. At
that time Lynch and his friends fancied I was drowned.
Strangely enough, Mike was the one most affected by
this belief. It seemed to upset him mentally, and no
one could convince him that I was not dead. On other
things he appeared rational enough, but he certainly
was queer on that point. Whenever he met me he
refused to look at me. They told me he invariably
flew into a passion if any one spoke of my escape from
drowning. After being hit by that baseball to-day
Lynch seemed rational for the first time in many days.
You know I did what I could to restore him to consciousness.
When he came round he stated that he
seemed to have dreamed that I was dead. I fancied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the shock had knocked the delusion out of his head and
restored him to his normal condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t know what sort of condition he was
in,” said Bertie; “but I do know he was sneaking up
behind you with this loaded pistol in his hand. You
can imagine what he meant to do. I don’t like to
think of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he meant to shoot me,” muttered Dick, “the fellow
was certainly crazy. There’s no other explanation.
No chap in his right mind would attempt such a
deed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably he meant to plead brain storm as an excuse,”
said Lee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick shook his head decisively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must refuse to believe that Lynch contemplated
any such dastardly act. Perhaps there’s nothing but
powder in this pistol. Perhaps he had some freakish
scheme in his befogged mind. Lee, I’m going to find
out whether there’s anything more than powder in this
pistol. I haven’t anything to draw the charge, but
there’s another way to settle the point. Come down
into the back yard with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They descended the stairs and passed through the
kitchen into the back yard. Finding a heavy block of
wood, Merriwell placed it close to the fence, retreated
a few feet, and leveled the pistol at it. When he pulled
the trigger there was an explosion like the report of
a shotgun. Springing forward to the block of wood,
Dick examined it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Scott!” he cried, his face paling. “Look
here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>His finger pointed to the spot where two bullets had
entered the wood close to each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see it! I see it!” spluttered Lee. “That settles
it! Now you know the old thing was loaded with
something more than powder.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Dick took out his handkerchief and wiped beads of
perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mike Lynch must have been crazy,” he said huskily.
“Only a crazy man would think of using such a
weapon as this, anyhow. Any one in his right senses
would have chosen an up-to-date revolver. Kid, I
wish you’d ask the kitchen girl for a hatchet. I’m
going to get those bullets or slugs out of this block.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Maggie herself was on hand, having been
brought out by the report of the pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heavings save us!” she gasped, holding up her
hands. “What air you doing, Mr. Merriwell? You
nearly scat me to death a-shootin’ out here in the
yard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring me the hatchet, Maggie!” called Dick. “I
want to use it right away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl reëntered the house and reappeared with
a heavy, broad-bladed hatchet in her hand. Seizing
this implement, Dick split off a piece of the bullet-pierced
block.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, but there was a heavy charge of powder in
that old thing,” observed Lee. “Look how deep the
bullets went in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell hacked at the block until finally one of the
bullets was uncovered. Cutting away around it, he
pried it out with a corner of the hatchet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fresh-molded,” he muttered, holding it up. “See
how bright it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lee seized the hatchet and hacked away at the block
to bring the other bullet to light. While Bertie was
doing this, Dick produced his jackknife and tried the
blade on the bullet he had secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is not lead,” he announced. “It’s too hard
and too bright. If it were lead, it would have flattened
out. By Jove, Kid, this looks like silver to me!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Here’s the other one!” cried Lee. “They’re mates,
Dick. Say, if you’d ever got those through your head,
it would have been your everlasting finish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick took the second bullet, inspected it, compared
it with the first, and dropped them both into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bertie,” he said, “I want you to keep a close mouth
about this business. Don’t mention it to any one—at
least, don’t mention it until I give you permission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not liable to mention it,” said Bertie quickly.
“I don’t want Mike Lynch on my neck. I don’t know
what you think about it, Dick, but it seems to me that
Lynch had something mighty nasty in his mind when
he was sneaking up behind you. If he’s daffy, he
should be placed in confinement where he’ll do no injury
to any one. It isn’t right to let a crazy fellow
run loose. I’m afraid of him. If they don’t take care
of Lynch, I’m liable to get out of New Haven myself,
I tell you that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t hurry, Kid. If Mike Lynch is crazy enough
to attempt murder, I’m going to see that he is taken
care of. But first I think I shall talk with Lynch myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having arrived at such a decision, Dick wasted little
time. He proceeded straight to the room occupied
by Lynch and unhesitatingly knocked for admission.</p>

<p class='c007'>A voice called, “Come in!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch was sitting in a morris chair with a bandage
around his head. He was wearing a dressing gown
and looked pale and listless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Merriwell!” he said, with an intonation of
surprise as Dick appeared. “I didn’t suppose it was
you. Thought it might be some of my friends, but
they don’t seem to be in any hurry about calling to
find out whether I’m seriously injured or not. Won’t
you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“I’m not going to make a long call,” said Dick. “I
dropped in to ask you about this queer old pistol. Have
you ever seen it before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He produced the weapon and held it up before
Lynch as he spoke.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h2 id='XLIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br /> <span class='large'>LYNCH CONFESSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At sight of the pistol Mike started violently, betraying
much agitation. It seemed that his pale face grew
still whiter. For a moment he sat quite still, but finally,
summoning command of himself, he extended a hand
and took the weapon from Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell stood watching every shade of expression
that flitted across the face of the sandy-haired youth.
He was wondering if Mike would deny having seen
the pistol. In such a case Dick was ready with a hot
denouncement. In fact, he had practically determined
to make public the truth of the affair and force Lynch
out of college. Why not? Certainly there was no
reason why he should permit the fellow to remain there
after this second attempt to commit murder. The running
down of the rowboat might be called a piece of
reckless maliciousness without any deliberate desire to
take human life, but when, with a loaded pistol in his
hand, a man creeps up behind another man whom he
hates, it certainly looks like premeditated crime of the
most bloodthirsty sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twice Lynch sought to moisten his lips with his
tongue before speaking. When he did speak his voice
was husky and faltering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did you get this, Merriwell?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You haven’t answered my question,” reminded
Dick coldly. “When you do answer it I’ll answer
yours. Have you ever seen that pistol before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I think I have,” muttered Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it was picked up on the baseball ground after
you were knocked senseless by that foul ball. It was
found where you dropped when the ball hit you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Lynch drew a deep breath and a shiver seemed to
run over him from his head to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it was no dream,” he whispered huskily. “I
was thinking about that when you came in. I was trying
to clear up things in my mind. I was wondering
what had really happened and what I had dreamed as
happening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still holding the pistol and fixing his gaze upon it,
Mike lifted one hand to his bandaged head, apparently
seeking to get a grip on his disturbed and scattered
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” he said, “I wish you would tell me a
few things. We ran down a rowboat containing you
and Buckhart, didn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buckhart escaped and was pulled on board our
launch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you—we saw nothing of you after the rowboat
was wrecked. We believed you were drowned.
Buckhart thought so. We searched for your body until
long after it was dark. Others joined in the search.
Finally we gave it up. That night in Fred’s saloon we
saw your white face through the panel hole in the wall.
We were drinking heavily. Du Boise fainted. I’m
sure both Ditson and myself believed we had seen an
apparition, a ghost. Du Boise tried to explain it by
saying it was a hallucination. I didn’t sleep much that
night—in fact, I don’t think I slept at all. I never
passed through such a night. At daybreak I started
out into the country, seeking to get away from myself
and my haunting thoughts. Perhaps you don’t believe
me, Merriwell, but I was the most wretched fellow in
the world. I didn’t think there was any real danger
that we would drown you when we ran your boat
down. I wanted to give you a ducking. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>malice in my heart perhaps, but not murder. I hope
you believe this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without speaking, Dick motioned for him to continue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say I started out early the following morning, but
I’m not sure of that. I don’t seem to know just what
happened. I have fancied it was nothing but a dream.
I have fancied that I remained and dreamed that I rose
and took a long walk into the country. In a strip of
woods I stopped to rest. Along came some fellows
taking a morning run. You were with them. This
seems to be a part of my dream. Tell me, Merriwell,
did such a thing happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, such a thing happened. You seemed terribly
excited at sight of me. You were brought back to
town and placed under the care of a doctor. To all
outward appearances, you recovered in a very short
time; but ever since then up to the present day you
have maintained that I was dead, and whenever you
met me you have refused to look at me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gripping the edge of the table, Lynch slowly rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you’ll not believe it, Merriwell,” he said,
“but I think I’ve been slightly deranged. Getting hit
by that baseball seems to have straightened out my
mind and brought me round.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell pointed sternly at the pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were you doing with that weapon?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t tell you,” he answered hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was the pistol loaded?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not loaded now, is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was it loaded when you started to creep up behind
me with it in your hand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it was.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“What were you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven help me! I am afraid I meant to shoot
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more Mike was trembling, and it seemed necessary
for him to cling to the study table in order to
stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad you see fit to tell me the truth,” said Dick
grimly. “Here are the bullets with which the pistol
was loaded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He produced them and held them in the hollow of
his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silver bullets!” whispered Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silver?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why silver?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To destroy a ghost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To what?” cried Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds foolish, doesn’t it?” muttered Lynch.
“It’s an old superstition. I heard my grandmother tell
of it when I was a mere child. My grandmother came
from Ireland. She said the only way to lay a spook
was to shoot it with a silver bullet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you—you believed such a ridiculous thing,
Lynch? That’s too much!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know whether I believed it or not,” muttered
Mike. “You understand that I was somewhat daffy.
Whenever I saw you I fancied I beheld a ghost. I
thought myself haunted. In this state of mind I remembered
the words of my grandmother and resolved
to exorcise you with the aid of silver bullets. I seemed
to remember some crazy conviction that you would
vanish instantly if shot with a silver bullet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of himself, Dick smiled. It seemed unspeakably
preposterous, and yet had not this fellow
crept upon him with a pistol containing such bullets?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I bought that old pistol,” Lynch went on. “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>see an ordinary pistol wouldn’t do. I had to get one
that used powder and ball. I bought a bullet mold
and had a number of silver bullets made. At first I
thought I would creep up behind you some time when
no one else was near, but after a while I decided that,
as long as you were a ghost, it made no difference
when I put an end to you. Certainly it could not be a
crime to destroy a ghost. I went to the game to-day
little thinking that I would find you there. When I
discovered you I couldn’t keep my eyes off you. I
don’t remember anything at all about the game. At
last I became so worked up that I resolved to do the
thing without loss of time. You know what followed.
This is the whole story, Merriwell. I don’t ask you to
believe a word of it. I don’t expect you to believe it.
I don’t think I would believe it if I were in your place.
I’ve made a confession. I acknowledge I tried to shoot
you. Under any circumstances I shall not deny it.
You have all the evidence you need against me. I’ll
wait here for the officers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be confessed that Merriwell was puzzled and
felt himself in a peculiar position. If Lynch spoke
the truth, Dick had no desire to punish him, as he now
seemed genuinely penitent. Furthermore, his actions
had been those of a deranged man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hadn’t you better take a vacation, Lynch?” suggested
Merriwell. “Don’t you think you need it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you mean that I must leave college for
good? You are going to force me out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I mean exactly what I said—I think it will
be beneficial to you if you take a vacation without waiting
for the term to close. I have not accepted your
story as true, and yet I hope it is true. I’ve always
fancied you to be a person with an ordinary amount
of common sense. No person with ordinary intelligence
would have thought of shooting an enemy, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>if your mind was in a condition that led you to try such
a thing, it’s high time that you gave up studying and
sought rest and quiet in the country. If you don’t,
you’re liable to break down entirely and go to pieces beyond
cure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I presume you’re afraid I’ll get another daffy
streak, and repeat the attempt on your life. I don’t
blame you, Merriwell. Still, I’m not going to leave
college now. I’m all right at the present moment, and
I believe I’ll remain so. You know I’ve been dreadfully
worried over my bills here, for I ran deeply in
debt. I didn’t know what would happen to me. I
thought I was swamped. As a last resort, I wrote a
letter to my mother, making a full confession. This
morning I received her answer. She sent me a check.
It was large enough to enable me to pay all my debts
and have something left over. For the first time in
weeks I’m straightened out and ready to go ahead
without worry. The only thing that will prevent me is
this business to-day. If you proceed against me, my
college career is ended. I have been a rather nasty
enemy toward you, Merriwell. I know that. I’ve
hated you bitterly, and I’ve tried my best to injure
you. It was wrong. Now I throw myself on your
mercy. Do whatever you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a sigh, Lynch sat down.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h2 id='XLV' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLV.<br /> <span class='large'>MIKE PUTS IT ON PAPER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a simple matter to imagine what would have
happened to Lynch had he, under similar circumstances,
thrown himself on the mercies of almost any
other boy whom he had hated and plotted against as
he had against Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the outset Merriwell’s intention had been to force
the truth from Mike’s lips, and then give him the
alternative of leaving college or being arrested at once.
Even now Dick hesitated and wondered if that was
the only course to pursue. He stood meditating, with
his eyes fastened upon Mike’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somehow, a most remarkable change seemed to have
come over Lynch. His face wore a sad, resigned expression
that was genuinely pathetic and appealing. It
had lost its usual grim and half-brutal aspect. Indeed,
as Dick watched, Mike’s chin began to quiver, and two
tears started from his eyes and rolled slowly down his
cheeks, although no sound came from his lips. Indeed,
he bowed his head, seemingly seeking to hide
these tokens of weakness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was the fellow faking, or was he genuinely repentant?
This question troubled Dick. Under any
circumstances, Merriwell believed the fellow needed the
attentions of a competent physician, for surely he must
have been mentally unbalanced for a time. It was
not reasonable to suppose he had been cured instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to think this matter over, Lynch,” said
Dick, after a few moments. “I want to do what is
right. If I decide to keep this thing quiet and make
no move against you, you must promise me one thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything,” murmured Lynch, without lifting his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“You must be examined by an expert in mental disorders.
If he says your mind is in such a condition
that you should quit college for a time, you must accept
his decision.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You agree, do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’m ready to agree to anything that will give
me a fair chance. I don’t want to leave college. I
believe I am all right now. Perhaps I need a little
medicine to tone me up, but that’s all. I appreciate
this, Merriwell. I can’t say much about it now, but
I think I’ll prove to you that I’m not ungrateful. I
know what would have happened to me had you been
almost any one else. I confess I was depending on
your generosity. You have been generous with all
your enemies—almost too generous. In the end you
overcome their enmity and win their respect. If you
were afraid of them, such would not be the case. At
first I thought you were afraid, but now I know my
mistake. I doubt if you fear any one in the world.
Tell me the truth, Merriwell. Were you really ever
afraid of anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed,” was the prompt answer. “No credit
for courage may be given a person who has never
known fear. It is the one who has experienced fear
and overcome it who is really brave. I’m going to
take this pistol, Lynch. I shall also keep these bullets.
I did not pick up this weapon after you dropped it.
Another person did that. In case I find you’re not
sincere in your seeming repentance, I’ll have evidence
enough against you to put you out of college in a
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike made no objection as Dick took the pistol and
thrust it into an inner pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll prove to you that I’m sincere,” he suddenly
exclaimed, once more rising to his feet. “You wait;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>I’ll place the proof in your hands this very night.
I’ll fix it so that you won’t need that pistol as evidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do?” asked Dick wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind,” said Lynch. “You’ll find out soon.
I would offer to shake hands with you, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prove to me beyond doubt that you’re genuinely
repentant and ready to do what’s right in future, and
you’ll find my hand open to you,” said Dick, as he
turned toward the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll prove it!” cried Mike, following him across the
room and letting him out. “You’ll be convinced sooner
than you think. Good night, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dick was gone Lynch turned back to his
study table, produced a paper pad, seized a pen, and
prepared to write.</p>

<p class='c007'>Across the top of the first page he wrote these
words: “Voluntary Statement of M. J. Lynch, Student
at Yale, Class of Umpty-ten.” This was followed
by the date.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point Lynch paused, with uplifted pen, and
a queer, crafty look flitted across his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall ask Merriwell to destroy this paper when he
is satisfied that I am sincere in my repentance. But
what if he forgets to destroy it? What if it falls into
other hands, and is read by some one for whose eyes
it is not intended? I must be cautious. I must look
out for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pulling the sheet from the pad, he tore it up and
flung the pieces into his waste basket. Then he arose,
crossed the room, and opened a drawer of his dresser,
from which he took a very small bottle of ink. Returning
to the table, he sat down, selected a fresh,
clean pen, and prepared to use the small bottle of ink.
For fully thirty minutes Lynch wrote.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“There,” he said at last, “there’s a full confession of
my connection with the running down of Buckhart’s
boat, and of my attempt to destroy Merriwell’s ghost
with silver bullets. Now, what I need is a witness for
my signature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The witness appeared directly, for Bern Wolfe entered
without pausing to rap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thought I’d come round to find out how you are,
Mike,” said Wolfe. “By George, you got a bump!
What the dickens were you doing, anyhow? You left
us on the bleachers, and went hustling away, after announcing
that you couldn’t stay there any longer, and
had decided to leave the field. How’d you happen to
get in there where you could be hit by that ball?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind that,” said Lynch. “You’re just the
fellow I want to use. I have a little document here
that I’m about to sign. I want you to attach your
name as witness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the document?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfe started to pick up the confession, but Lynch
hastened to prevent him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s private,” he said. “I can’t let you read it, you
know. All I wish of you is that you put your name
on as a witness to the genuineness of my signature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s funny,” muttered Bern. “I don’t often
sign anything unless I know what I’m hitching my
name to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not asking you to sign it. I’m asking you to
append your name as a witness to my signature. I
give you my word that it won’t get you into any
trouble. Here, I’m going to put my name to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike did so, writing his name in big, flourishing
letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down,” he said, getting up from the chair and
covering the paper with a blank sheet which left no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>more than the bottom line and his own signature in
view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfe took the chair and picked up a pen, dipping it
into the larger ink bottle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on!” cried Mike, catching his wrist and
checking him. “Don’t use that ink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, for certain reasons that I won’t name. Take
that other pen, please, and use the ink from this smaller
bottle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you rather fussy?” grunted Wolfe, as he
complied. “Where do you want me to write and what
do you want me to write?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Write here,” indicated Mike. “Write these words:
‘Witness for M. J. Lynch.’ Then sign your name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bern followed instructions, and then paused, with
pen suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey? What’s this?” he muttered, staring at the
exposed line of writing. “What’s this about ‘a full and
complete confession?’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right,” said Lynch, hastily catching up
the sheets of paper. “Don’t be such a rubberneck,
Bern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having made sure that the ink was dry upon the
paper, Mike carefully placed the sheets together, folded
them, and slipped them into an envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, if you’ll let me sit there a moment, Wolfe,”
he suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more sitting down, Lynch addressed the envelope,
using the ink from the larger bottle. Bern
peered inquisitively over Mike’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh?” he ejaculated. “Richard Merriwell? Say,
what the dickens are you writing to Dick Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a queer, grave smile, Lynch found a stamp and
affixed it to the envelope.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“It won’t hurt you if you don’t know, Bern,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have a right to know,” spluttered Wolfe. “If
I had thought you were writing anything to him, you’d
never got my autograph on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make yourself comfortable,” said Mike, as he
tossed aside his dressing gown and took a coat from
his wardrobe. “I’m going to step down to the mail
box.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Needn’t trouble yourself so much,” said Wolfe,
with sudden eagerness. “You’re not feeling well,
Mike. Give me the letter. I’ll mail it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Lynch shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t trust you,” he said. “I wouldn’t trust
any one. I’m going to mail it myself. I’ll be back in
a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what does it mean?” growled Wolfe, as
Lynch went out with the letter in his hand.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>When Mike returned he was accompanied by Duncan
Ditson and Mel Dagett. The moment they were
in the room and the door was closed, Dunc turned
fiercely on Mel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confound you!” he cried. “I tell you I haven’t
any money! I tell you I can’t pay! I’m broke—dead
broke! You know it! You know what happened at
Providence. I raked up every dollar I could raise to
bet against Umpty-ten, and lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I know that,” sneered Dagett. “I let you
have part of the money. Didn’t I lose, too? That’s
why I want you to pay me. I need it. I’m strapped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell that to your grandmother,” sneered Dunc.
“You’re not strapped. Why, you’ve been loaning
money at twenty per cent a month for the last five
months. You’ve bled everybody you could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’ve been unfortunate,” whined Mel. “I took
your advice on that Brown game, and you see what
happened. You agreed to pay me a week ago. I’ve
been putting it off to give you time. You said you’d
have money to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I thought I’d get some from home. It
hasn’t come. Do you know how I’ve managed to
scrub along the past week? Well, I’ll tell you: I’ve
borrowed from my sister. Yes, borrowed from my
sister, and she gets what little money she has by teaching
music. It comes hard enough, and she needs every
dollar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got to have ten,” hissed Mel, wagging his
head from side to side. “I won’t wait any longer.
Can’t you borrow that of her?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Say, I’d like to choke you! No, I can’t; see?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, there’s only one thing for me to do,”
said Mel, with a shrug of his shoulders and an upward
toss of his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to raise money on the securities you let
me have. That was according to the agreement. I’ll
have to find out what they’ll bring.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you sell my stuff, I’ll knock the head off you!”
shouted Duncan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t yell like that in this room,” remonstrated
Lynch. “I can’t have it, Ditson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But look at that cursed Shylock!” panted Dunc,
pointing at Mel. “He’d steal coppers off a dead man’s
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have no right to say that,” complained Dagett.
“Simply because I do business in a businesslike fashion
you insult me. I suppose you think I ought to let you
have the money for nothing. I suppose you think I
ought to give it to you. Mike has paid me what he
owes me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has he?” exclaimed Ditson, in surprise. “Why,
I didn’t know——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down, both of you fellows,” directed Lynch.
“Sit down, I say. That’s right, Dagett, back yourself
into that chair. Now, look here, Dunc, how much do
you owe Mel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I agreed to pay him ten dollars this week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much is the full amount that you owe him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forty-five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What security has he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two rings, a watch, and my scarfpin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Worth how much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the rings are worth thirty or forty dollars.
The pin is worth about ten. I don’t suppose I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>get more than fifteen or eighteen on the watch, but to
me it’s worth twice that, as it was a present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you get those things and bring them here right
away, Dagett?” asked Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, yes, if——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then hustle—hustle, I say! Get them! Go ahead
now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what’s the use if he can’t pay?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch smote the table with his huge fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he can’t pay, I can!” he roared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Duncan Ditson gasped with astonishment, for this
was the last thing he had expected from Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he can’t pay, I can,” repeated Lynch. “We have
been friendly, and I’m going to get him out of your
greedy clutches, Dagett.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you needn’t pay the whole of it,” said Mel
quickly. “I only want what’s due this week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You only want to keep him indebted to you, so you
can continue to squeeze him. If he can’t pay what’s
due next week, then you’ll threaten to sell his stuff.
I know your game, Dagett, and it’s a mighty dirty
one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, don’t you start to preach to me,” sneered
Mel. “I guess you’ve been in some dirty jobs yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have,” acknowledged Lynch instantly. “I’ve
been in a number of them, but that’s past now, and
I’m done with it. Understand, I say I’m done with
it. I’ve turned over a new leaf, and in future I’m
going to conduct myself differently. Don’t grin,
Dagett; I mean business. Your warped and distorted
mind may not be able to comprehend me, but I mean
just what I say. Heretofore I’ve carried around a
grouch that has made me ugly and disagreeable even
toward my own friends. I haven’t enjoyed life. I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>been getting little satisfaction out of it. From now
on I’m going to follow a different plan. I begin here
and now by helping one chap to get out of your
clutches, Dagett, even though it leaves me practically
broke. Now get those things and bring them here
just as quick as you can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson and Wolfe exchanged wondering glances.
When Mel had left the room, Duncan started to express
his thanks, but Mike cut him short.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why shouldn’t I do it?” he said. “Haven’t we
been on friendly terms? What’s a friend good for if
he won’t help another out in a time of need?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee! is this Mike Lynch?” muttered Wolfe. “Say,
Dunc, what do you think I caught him doing? You
can’t guess, so don’t try. I caught him writing a
letter to Dick Merriwell, and he induced me to hitch
on my name as a witness to his signature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were you doing, Lynch?” grinned Ditson.
“Telling Merriwell to go to the dickens?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” was the answer. “I was telling him something
entirely different. You heard me inform Dagett
that I have turned over a new leaf. I wasn’t talking
to hear the sound of my own voice. Did you ever
hear me admit that I consider Merriwell the whitest
man in college? You never did, but I admit it now.
I’m through trying to throw him down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Ditson and Wolfe seemed thunderstruck. At
first Duncan was inclined to ridicule Lynch, but he
quickly discovered that Mike would not endure ridicule
on that point.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time Dagett returned with the valuables belonging
to Duncan, Ditson was satisfied that some remarkable
change had taken place in Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike paid the money due Dagett. With his own
hands he destroyed the agreement held by Mel and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>signed by Ditson, by which Duncan was bound to
meet the extortioner’s demands or suffer the penalty
of having his valuables disposed of to raise the cash.</p>

<p class='c007'>This done, Mike took Mel by the collar, led him to
the door, and ejected him from the room.</p>

  <h2 id='XLVII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVII.<br /> <span class='large'>A BITTER DOSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the freshman team arrived in New Haven
that night, Dick Merriwell was the only one who appeared
at the station to meet them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sorry, downcast-looking bunch they were as they
left the train, carrying their bat bags and satchels.
Blessed Jones had a face nearly a yard long. Jack
Spratt looked as if he had shed tears and had a reserve
supply on tap and ready for delivery. Rob
Claxton carried his head high, but could not disguise
the fact that he was very much disgusted. The round
face of Bouncer Bigelow wore a moonish expression
of mingled regret and shame. Brad Buckhart looked
ugly enough to eat railroad spikes. Even Tommy
Tucker seemed upset and downcast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of them all, however, Sam Kates appeared to be
the most wretched. He lingered behind, being the
last one to reach the platform, and showed an inclination
to slip away from the others if he could do so
without being detected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although they saw Dick waiting for them, the most
of the boys declined to meet his inquisitive eyes. Truly,
it was with no small difficulty that Merriwell repressed
a rising inclination to shout with laughter. In spite of
himself, a faint smile crept over his face, and this he
tried to conceal by covering his lips with his hand.
Buckhart had observed it, however, and he stopped
at Dick’s side, glaring at his friend as he muttered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you laugh, you certain take your life in your
hand, partner. You’ll have the whole blamed bunch
on your back like a lot of catamounts. They are sure
the ugliest crowd I ever traveled with. We’ve had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>three scraps on the way here, and if you’ll take a
look at Otis Fitch, you’ll discover that he’s wearing a
handsome black eye. He made some uncomplimentary
remark about Spratt’s fielding, and Spratt punched
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you must have had a hot time,” observed
Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hot sure is no name for it. Don’t ask any questions
now. Wait till we get under cover. I want to
sneak in by the back way. Think of being walloped
by a lot of high-school kids. Waugh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Never had the Texan expressed greater disgust than
he threw into that final exclamation. Swinging on his
heel, he strode away, regardless of Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Failing to accept Brad’s warning, Dick took Jones
by the arm and began to question him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A wise head containeth a silent tongue,” muttered
the disgruntled captain of the freshman team.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he that seeketh diligently after wisdom shall
obtain it,” reminded Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he that is devoured by much inquisitiveness
causeth disturbance,” retorted Blessed. “Let us seek
the shelter of our roof tree before we prattle of our
disgrace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Evidently you all take it sorely to heart,” said Merriwell.
“I never saw such a cut-up looking bunch of
ball players.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cut up? If I’d let them scrap on the train, they’d
be worse cut up than they are now. Dick, I’m afraid
harmony on the team is a thing of the past. This has
been a fatal day. And they all blame Robinson and
me for letting you stay behind. Don’t talk of it
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was all he could get out of Jones until they
were in their room. With his door open, Buckhart
could be heard prowling about in the adjoining room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>but he seemed quite willing to let Blessed explain how
the thing had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Jones, it was a case of overconfidence
by Umpty-ten, followed by the rattles when Highbridge
fell on Kates and batted him out of the box.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who filled Sam’s place?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Spratt helped the suffering along,” groaned
Blessed. “He’s been wanting to show what he could
do on the slab, and I gave him a chance. Every one
of those kids got a bingle off him. So help me, Joshua,
it was an unspeakable relief when the game finally
dragged to an end!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buckhart stuck his head in at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When Highland can do us up,” he said, “we’ll
make a fine showing against those Manhattan College
sons of Erin. If those husky Irishmen don’t eat us
up Wednesday, it will certain be a miracle. You hear
me murmur!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dick will pitch that game,” said Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he’ll have a fine team behind him,” said the
Texan. “Unless some one pours oil on the troubled
waters, I don’t believe we’ll get out more than half
the team next week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you were to blame for a good deal of the
trouble,” declared Jones. “You told Kates he was
bum, you reviled Spratt, you derided Bigelow, and
Claxton was about the only man you didn’t insult. I
suppose you realized you’d have a fight on your hands
if you said much to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was enough to make anybody sit up on his
haunches and howl like a wolf,” said the Texan, as
he stepped through the doorway. “I won’t get over
it in a month.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, forget it! forget it!” piped a voice, as Tommy
Tucker pushed open the door and peered in. “Still
chewing it over? What’s the use? Say, Dick, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>you heard the story about the powdered sugar?
Haven’t heard it? Well, it’s fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bang!—a shoe flew past Tucker and struck the half-open
door, which was knocked against the nose of
Bouncer Bigelow, who had just started to peer into
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” cried the fat boy, grabbing his nasal
organ with both hands. “Be careless, will you? What
are you trying to do, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shoe fly, don’t bother me!” cried Tucker. “Come
in quick and close the door. These people seem violent.
We may have to sit on them, and you’re the
proper size and weight for that job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonder you didn’t make my nose bleed,” grunted
Bigelow, as he came in and leaned against the closed
door. “What is it, another fight? Jerusalem! there
hasn’t been a thing doing but fights ever since the
middle of that game. Never saw such a scrappy crowd.
But, say, there were a lot of pretty girls out to the
game. They enjoyed it immensely seeing Highland
rub it into us. They kept squealing their class cheer
and waving their flags until I was afraid they would
all have spasms. I can’t seem to get the sound of
that yell out of my ears. It was a sort of a hiky-yi!
ye-yo! yow! wow! wow! Even when they were yelling
their loudest they were pretty. I tell you, fellows,
the fair sex is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s natural,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not always,” grinned Tucker. “Sometimes it’s
artificial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But really,” said Bouncer, “I can’t understand girls.
I don’t believe any fellow ever does. Somehow, they
seem to understand us better than we do them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That began with the first woman created,” said
Tommy. “See how well old Mother Eve understood
old Father Adam.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“That was because she was on the inside at the beginning,”
said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Somebody loan me a brick, please,” begged Tucker.
“I’ll give it to Merriwell—good and hard!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem to have recovered from your recent depression,”
said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he doesn’t know enough to remain depressed
long,” sneered Bigelow. “He told me he was coming
in to punch Buckhart for insulting him. I came to
save his life if he tried it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to assemble the braves and smoke the
pipe of peace,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you show such unseemly merriment?”
snarled Jones. “I believe you’re pleased because we
were beaten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got another guess coming,” said Dick. “But
there’s no use crying over spilled milk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth
her voice?’” mocked Blessed. “I think we’d better call
the team together and choose a new captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Choose a new captain?” exclaimed Merriwell, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure. I couldn’t seem to do anything with that
crazy bunch after Kates went to pieces. The more
I talked to them, the worse they played. They wouldn’t
pay any attention to my orders, yet the wise in heart
will receive commandments, but prating fools shall
fall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Weren’t you too harsh in your manner of reproving
them?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge, but he
that hateth reproof is brutish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid you all lost your heads,” said Dick. “It
may do the team some good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can that be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A team that can’t take defeat isn’t fit to win victories.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>An occasional failure acts like tonic on an
ambitious person. Let’s call this a good dose of tonic
for the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Call it that if you like,” muttered Brad. “It tasted
bitter enough, anyhow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>
  <h2 id='XLVIII' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>WAS HE SINCERE?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following day being Sunday, the boys were
given a chance to rest. It was a gloomy, sullen set
that appeared at training table, and all efforts to arouse
them seemed wasted. One fellow was missing. Kates
was reported ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick found an opportunity to hunt Sam up and talk
to him. Kates would have avoided Merriwell, but he
could not do so, and he faced Dick with a crestfallen
air of shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you really ill, Sam?” Dick questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet I am,” was the answer. “I’m downright
sick. I haven’t been right for a day or two, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I didn’t know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact was Dick had fancied Kates in the very
best of health and in fine spirits the day before the
game with Highland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s true,” persisted Sam; “there’s something
the matter with me. I can’t stand for training-table
feed. It makes me sick. All I can think of is rare
roast beef and stuff like that. I’d like to sit down
and make a square meal off cake and pie and ice cream
and strawberries and chocolates and bon-bons. I think
it’s all rot this tying a fellow down on a certain line
of diet. One man’s food is another’s poison, you know.
How’s any one going to tell me what I need to eat
unless he’s an expert physician, and I’m ill with dyspepsia,
or something of that sort? No wonder I
couldn’t pitch yesterday. Jones is too blamed rigid
with the team. It needs some one more liberal. Then
there’s Robinson—he keeps watch of us as if we were
criminals or a jury sitting on a murder case. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>day—some day I’m going to punch that man Robinson.
I tell you I’m in revolt, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me tell you something, Sam,” said Dick
quietly: “You’re trying to make unnecessary excuses
for yourself. You’re disgusted because you were batted
hard Saturday, and so you think you’ve got to lay
the blame to something. Shoulder it, shoulder it—that’s
the only way. Evidently you were not wholly
to blame. According to what I’ve learned, there were
some rotten errors made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they did hit me hard,” groaned Kates, shaking
his head. “Merriwell, I believe there were some ringers
in that bunch. I don’t believe they were all high-school
boys. I never saw a high-school team hit the
way they did. The more I’ve thought about it, the
sicker I’ve grown. It took the heart out of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m sorry to know that you’ll let a thing like
that take the heart out of you, Kates. You’ve got to
have more backbone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose Buckhart told you all about our trouble?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know as he mentioned any particular trouble
with you, Kates. It seems that the whole team
was fussing and quarreling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Buckhart called me a few names that I couldn’t
swallow. I told him I’d never pitch to him again until
he apologized, and I meant it. He’s got to apologize,
Merriwell, or I’m done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A better way would be to drop it—to forget all
about it,” said Dick. “This demanding an apology
for every hasty and unintentional word is a poor business.
The rest of the fellows have practically dropped
it, and you should do the same, Kates.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you say that because Buckhart is your
particular friend. I suppose you think I ought to
apologize to him, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think either of you should demand an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>apology from the other. Nor should you hold a
grudge. You’re not playing for Buckhart; you’re playing
for the team. Think it over, Kates. I’ll expect
to see you out with the others to-morrow afternoon.
We’ve got to get together and play ball if we hope to
defeat Manhattan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to play different ball than we did Saturday,”
said Sam, as Dick departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday morning Dick received a letter that surprised
him unspeakably. It was the confession of Mike
Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that beats!” he cried when he had finished
reading it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” questioned Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to show this to you,” said Dick. “I’d like
to have you read it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But when Jones reached for the letter, Merriwell
drew it away, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I can’t, old man,” he said. “It’s confidential.
The fellow who wrote this has trusted me. He has
placed himself in my hands. With this document I
could have him expelled from college. He has thrown
himself on my mercy. The fellow must be sincere.
He certainly protests that he is, and he urges me to
keep this letter, to be used against him in case I ever
find he is not in earnest. I think I’ll take him at his
word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning the confession to the envelope, Merriwell
placed it in a drawer which he always kept locked,
and the key of which he carried constantly. From
this drawer he took the queer old horse pistol and the
two silver bullets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the dickens have you there?” asked Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks like a young cannon, doesn’t it?” smiled
Dick, as he procured a sheet of wrapping paper and
carefully wrapped the pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to return it to its owner. Remember
he that is devoured by much inquisitiveness causeth
disturbance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carrying the carefully wrapped pistol under his arm,
Dick knocked at the door of Mike Lynch’s room. Mike
was on the point of going out. He flushed as Merriwell
entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s that pistol you asked for,” said Dick, handing
the weapon over. “Here are also the silver bullets.
What do you propose to do with these things?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you got my letter, did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I received it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And read it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to hang this pistol on the wall yonder.
I’m going to keep it there as a reminder of my pledge
to you. It will be a warning of what my folly led
me into. It will also remind me of your generosity
toward me. That letter ought to convince you that
I mean business when I say I’ve turned over a new
leaf.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It begins to look as if you do, Lynch,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you surprised by the contents of the letter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was surprised, perhaps; but you told me nothing
I did not already know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I told you nothing you did not suspect.
But you had absolutely no proof that I was really the
one who betrayed the team some weeks ago. That
was a dirty piece of business, Merriwell, and I’m heartily
ashamed of it. I did it out of spite toward you.
You see, I am in your power now. If I do another
dirty trick, you can publish that confession, and that
will be my finish. Not many fellows in my place would
dare trust any one as I’ve trusted you, for not many
fellows in your place would treat their enemies with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the generosity you show them. I wish you would
promise me one thing, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless something happens to convince you that I’m
insincere in my resolve to behave in future, I hope
you’ll never read the contents of that letter again.
You’ve perused it once, and you know what there is
in it. This may sound like a queer request, and I
don’t know as I can make you understand my reason
for it. You think badly enough of me now. If I
behave, and you begin to believe there is a decent
streak in me, you may get the belief knocked out of
you if you reread that confession. That’s why I hope
you’ll never look at it after this day. When you’re
satisfied—thoroughly satisfied—that I mean to do
right, I wish you would return that confession to me,
that I may destroy it. While it remains in existence
there’ll always be the danger that it may fall into the
hands of some one who’ll use it against me. Oh, I
realized this when I wrote it. I’m taking all the
chances. I’ve asked you to keep it where it will be
safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s under lock and key at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that’s not always safe. Don’t think I’m sorry
I wrote it. Don’t think I want to squeal. I could
see no other way to convince you that I meant to do
the right thing. I wanted a chance to prove myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall have it, Lynch,” said Dick earnestly.
“But don’t forget your promise to consult a physician.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve done so already. I was thoroughly examined
yesterday. The doctor says he sees no reason why I
should leave college at the present time. He thinks
I’ll go through the term all right. I’m certain there’s
nothing the matter with me now, Merriwell. That
bump on the head straightened me out.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“I have just one question to ask,” said Dick.
“Wolfe’s name was hitched to that confession as a
witness. Did he read it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; he simply saw me sign my name. I didn’t
permit him to read it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought not,” nodded Dick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>
  <h2 id='XLIX' class='c005'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br /> <span class='large'>A WASTED WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another surprise followed. Lynch came out to
watch the team practice that afternoon. When Kates
failed to appear, Mike asked permission to cover first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me try it, Merriwell,” he begged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re asking the wrong man,” said Dick. “I’m
not captain of the team. You’ll have to call on Jones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he won’t give me a show unless you say something.
Won’t you say something? You know I can
play baseball. The rest of them know I can play, too,
but they won’t trust me. It wouldn’t do any hurt to
let me practice with the team. Just say a word to
Jones, won’t you, Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus importuned, Dick trotted over to Blessed and
told him of Mike’s appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That fellow!” growled Jones. “Forwardness is in
his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth
discord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he has promised——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put no dependence in the promises of such as he.
I wouldn’t trust him, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He can do no particular harm in practice to-day.
We’re not trying out any signal work. Let him cover
first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” growled Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Lynch got his chance to practice. Although he
was not in uniform, he stripped off coat and vest, rolled
up his sleeves; and went at it in earnest. His work
at first was of an order to cause some favorable comment
from the spectators. Not a man in the infield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>entertained a friendly feeling toward Mike. For this
reason, all sorts of erratic throws were sent over to
him. The stops he made were simply marvelous.
Time after time he stretched himself on the ground
with his toe clinging to the sack and scooped the low
ones. Again and again he leaped into the air and
pulled down high ones which seemed far beyond his
reach. Hot grounders and whistling liners he took
whenever they came in his direction. Not only that,
but his throwing to second and third and to the plate
was little short of perfect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s the man to cover that hassock,” some one
finally cried. “He’s needed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones, at work in the field, did not fail to notice
what was happening, and began to regret that Lynch
had been tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we don’t give him a show, there’ll be a fuss,”
muttered Blessed. “Jerusalem! this old baseball team
is worrying me to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The report that Lynch had been tried on first
reached the campus ahead of the players that night. It
caused something of a sensation among the freshmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the news reached the ears of three fellows,
they made haste to Mike’s room, seeking confirmation.
Bern Wolfe came upon Ditson and Du Boise
upon the steps, and the trio sailed in upon Lynch without
announcement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say!” cried Ditson challengingly; “what’s this yarn
that’s come to our ears?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike, with a towel bound round his head, rose from
his chair by the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What yarn?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, we understand you’ve been out practicing
with the Merriwell crowd.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Yes, and we want to know about it!” snapped
Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been out practicing with the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you have?” snarled Ditson. “Now, what do
you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose he’s going to try to get onto the team,”
sneered Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You couldn’t make a better guess if you had several
more tries,” said Lynch coolly.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seemed to be a staggerer for Bern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wh-what?” he gasped. “You don’t mean it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lynch, you’re plumb daffy,” said Ditson. “Why,
you’re the last fellow in the world to strike his colors
and surrender to that bunch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re crazy!” shouted Wolfe furiously. “You
know what happened to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know what happened,” remarked Mike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They kicked me off the team after giving me a
show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For excellent reasons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you were frothing mad with me because I
thought of getting onto the team in the first place.
You were furious with Kates, and now you’re going
to try for it. That’s too much, Lynch. I won’t
stand it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how you can help it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll—I’ll tell a few things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t tell anything that’ll hurt me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, can’t I?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a thing. Do you remember I had you affix
your name to a document I had just completed Saturday.
Well, that’s a full confession, and it’s now in
Merriwell’s hands. In that I took all the blame for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>a certain affair in which you and I were concerned.
You ought to know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sig——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can tell these fellows about it if you wish,” interrupted
Mike hastily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you’ve told Merriwell, everybody’ll know it.
Lynch, you’re daffy. You’re crazy as a March hare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think so. You’ll observe that I was given
a chance to practice with the team to-day. I believe
I’ll have still further opportunities. Unless I’m mistaken,
I’ll be playing on the team before the end of
the season.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where will I be?” cried Wolfe. “It was your
scheme that threw me off the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve explained that, Bern. I’ve shouldered everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Duncan Ditson whistled wonderingly as he sank
upon a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the devil has happened to you, Lynch?” he
asked. “I swear I can’t comprehend it. I agree with
Wolfe that you’re bughouse. You’d better hold up
right where you are. You’d better not try to get in
with the Merriwell crowd. If you do, you’ll find
yourself in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute, Duncan,” urged Mike quietly.
“You’ve called yourself my friend, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But now you threaten to quit me. Have you forgotten
what I did for you Saturday? Have you forgotten
how I saved you from the grip of Shylock
Dagett? I am still your friend, Ditson. You may
need me again. Wolfe may need me. If either of you
need assistance, don’t hesitate to come to me. I’ll do
what I can for you. But I can’t listen to your talk
now. I’ve got a headache. I wish you would both
get out.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Ditson sprang up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go,” he snapped. “By Jove! I don’t know what
the class of Umpty-ten is coming to. Every man in
it will be prostrating himself at Merriwell’s feet if this
thing keeps up. It’s simply disgusting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what it is!” cried Wolfe, as he followed
Ditson from the room, slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike returned to his chair and sat down with a
weary expression, resting his head on his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’d better go, too,” murmured Du Boise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute,” said Lynch. “Were you ever troubled
with headaches, Hal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had them bad, did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ever use any headache powders?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What kind would you recommend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No kind,” answered Du Boise, at once. “They’re
good things to let alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? Don’t they stop the headache?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure they do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why let them alone? I’ll tell you. Almost all of
them contain cocaine. I acquired the drug habit by
using headache powders, to begin with, Lynch. Don’t
touch the things. The kind that seem to do you the
most good are the most dangerous, for they invariably
contain the most cocaine. Cure your headaches in
some other way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Much obliged, Du Boise,” said Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>But ten minutes after Hal had left, Mike put on his
coat and hat and proceeded to the nearest drug store,
where he purchased some headache powders. And in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>twenty minutes after taking the first powder his headache
had vanished, and he was feeling like a fighting
cock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warning of Du Boise, himself a wreck from the
use of drugs, had fallen on barren ground.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='L' class='c005'>CHAPTER L.<br /> <span class='large'>WOLFE HAS AN IDEA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Reaching the street after leaving Mike Lynch’s
room, Wolfe and Ditson paused and looked at each
other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of it?” asked Bern, in
a disgusted way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It beats me,” declared Dunc. “There’s something
the matter with the fellow. There’s been something
the matter with him ever since the night we accidentally
ran down Merriwell and Buckhart as they were rowing
on the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Accidentally?” murmured Bern, with a crafty wink.
“Are you sure it was an accident, old chap?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we didn’t take particular pains to avoid hitting
their boat. I don’t understand now how it was
Merriwell escaped. He disappeared, and we saw nothing
of him. Even Buckhart thought for a time that
he was drowned. You see, Lynch got a foolish idea
into his head that he was haunted by Merriwell’s ghost.
When the rest of us learned that Merriwell was still
alive, Mike persisted in fancying him dead. That was
the first indication of an unbalanced mind. He seems
to have thrown off that delusion, but with its disappearance
he has suddenly changed in a most astonishing
way. He was the bitterest and most persistent of
Merriwell’s enemies. Now he’s joined the ranks of
the Merriwell toadies. All of a sudden he’s got good.
Think of Mike Lynch doing anything like that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the devil a saint would be, the devil a saint
was he,” quoted Wolfe. “I can’t believe he’s in earnest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Somehow, I think he is. He’s not the sort of fellow
to try deception on us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“Well, confound him!” snapped Bern. “If he’s
really in earnest, I’d like to punch him. Only for him
I might be playing on the baseball team now. I’d like
to tell you a few things, Ditson. Where can we go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s my room,” suggested Dunc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The very place,” said Bern eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the anti-Merriwellites Ditson was something
of an aristocrat. He was a fellow who regarded himself
as very exclusive and well-bred. He roomed
alone, and his rooms were furnished with something
like luxury. There were fine rugs on the floors, plenty
of books, easy lounging chairs, athletic pictures on the
walls, and the usual Yale flags, crossed foils, boxing
gloves, Indian clubs, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got slick rooms,” observed Bern, as he flung
himself on Duncan’s comfortable, cushion-piled couch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, they don’t satisfy me,” said Ditson. “I’m going
to have something decent next term. I’ve got the
rooms spotted now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, you’re going to leave this locality?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I should say so. You don’t suppose I’d hang
around Freshman Row in my sophomore year? I’ll
be glad when I get into a dormitory. Have a smoke,
Wolfe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bern accepted a cigarette, and lighted it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is my only consolation for being dropped from
the baseball team,” he said. “I can smoke as much
as I choose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were going to tell me something,” reminded
Duncan, who had likewise fired up, and was now
standing with his elbow resting against the mantelpiece.
“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfe sat up and eyed his companion askance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know just how to begin,” he hesitated.
“You remember that Hudson A. A. business—the giving
away of our signals, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“As if I’d forget it!” exclaimed Ditson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you always thought Tommy Tucker betrayed
the team, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe that was practically proven, although Merriwell
hired a cheap bum to shoulder the blame, and
Tucker is still on the team.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tucker didn’t do it,” announced Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tucker didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then who did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha-a-at?” Duncan dragged forth the exclamation
with an intonation of great astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I did it,” repeated Wolfe defiantly. “I was
forced into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By whom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mike Lynch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did he force you into it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he knew something about me that I wouldn’t
have come out for the world, and he threatened to
expose me unless I went in with him on his plan to
throw down the team. You see, I had a good chance
to do that. Tommy Tucker had quit, and I was almost
the only man who could come anywhere near
filling his place at shortstop. They had to have as
good a man as they could get. I believe I can play
the position all around Tucker. I went out and
showed them what I could do. Merriwell advised
Jones to give me a chance on the team, and Jones decided
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, of course!” sneered Ditson, exhaling a blue
smoky breath while his lips curled with scorn. “Jones
is a mere figurehead. He agrees to everything Merriwell
proposes. Manager Robinson is another dummy.
Manager? Why, he couldn’t manage a chicken hatchery.
He’s about the biggest slob in the whole bunch.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Ditson’s doubled disgust for Robinson came principally
from the fact that big Rufe had at one time
seemed inclined to favor the anti-Merriwell crowd.
After becoming manager of the team Robinson had
flopped, cutting out Duncan and his associates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I had my chance to make good and nail myself
fast to the team,” Wolfe hastily continued. “I
meant to do it. I was in earnest, for I love baseball
more than any other sport. Lynch became infuriated
with me. You know what he thinks of Sam Kates.
Kates got his chance on the team the same time I did.
He’s stuck there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he made a beautiful mess pitching that Highbridge
game,” smiled Duncan, filliping a bit of ash
from his cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, as a pitcher Sam is erratic. He’s a wizard one
day and a slob the next. That experience will teach
them better than to rely on him, even against the
weaker teams. As I was saying, Lynch put up that
Hudson job. He got me to make out a list of the
teamwork signals. He told me how we could make
money by handing the signals over to Newhouse, the
Hudson manager. But I didn’t propose to have those
signals turning up in my handwriting, and so we engaged
a bummer to get them typewritten for us. In
order to doubly cover our tracks, we actually fooled
Newhouse into believing that Tucker was the one who
gave him the signals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lynch made the bargain with Newhouse, and arranged
that I should meet the man on a certain dark
corner, and give him the typewritten document. I kept
the appointment, wearing an old ulster, with the collar
turned up, and a wide-brimmed hat pulled low down
over my eyes. When Newhouse inquired if my name
was Tucker I said yes. That’s the way the trick was
worked. It was a mighty rotten piece of business, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Lynch was to blame for it all. He drove me into it.
I’m satisfied that Merriwell got at the truth, and that’s
why I was bounced from the team and Tucker taken
back. You can’t blame me, Ditson. You see the kind
of a fix I was in. I didn’t want to do it, but I had to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Duncan tossed the butt of his cigarette into the open
grate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see,” he said, with a shrug of his shoulders; “and
I’ve been thinking all the time that Tucker did it.
I’ve been despising Merriwell because he kept Tucker
on the team. I must acknowledge that you and Lynch
fooled me, all right. I’m sorry to learn that Tucker
was not the traitor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t want to be a traitor,” said Wolfe. “Do
you wonder I’m sore on Mike Lynch? I tell you I
love baseball. I’m not playing, and Lynch is to blame
for it. Now he suddenly has a spasm of virtue, and
it looks as if he might get a chance to play on the
team himself. Think I’m going to stand for that?
Not on your life! Say, I’m going to make a howl.
I’m going to rip up things generally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you?” smiled Ditson, as he selected and lighted
a second cigarette. “I wonder how you’re going to
do it. It seems to me you’re in a tight corner, and
you haven’t much chance to make a disturbance. Didn’t
I understand Lynch to say he had written a full confession
of his errors and sent it to Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what he says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there you are. Merriwell has read that confession,
and yet this very day Lynch was given a
chance to practice with the team. What does that look
like to you, Wolfe? Doesn’t it strike you that Merriwell
has accepted Mike Lynch’s protestations of regret
and promises to reform as genuine? If Merriwell
didn’t believe Mike in earnest, the contents of
that confession would be public knowledge now. Merriwell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>is going to keep still until he can satisfy himself
whether Lynch means what he says or not. If
Mike proves that he’s sincere, that confession will be
destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Mr. Lynch will come out on top of the heap,
while you and I will remain in the soup,” snarled
Wolfe, leaping up and excitedly pacing the floor.
“You’d like to play baseball yourself, Ditson. Have
you had a chance to play this spring?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I suppose I might have played if I had bowed
the suppliant knee to the great mogul, Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you wouldn’t do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not much!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly all the rest of the crowd have squealed and
given in to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never squeal. The squealers make me sick!
Mike Lynch was the last one I’d ever thought would
lie down. I’m more disgusted with him than any one
else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad you are—I’m glad of it!” said Bern exultantly.
“I hate him! I’d like to get a good twist
on him! I’d like to hold his nose to the grindstone!
It would do my soul good! And to think I witnessed
his signature to that confession! To think Merriwell
has that document with my name attached as a witness!
I’d give something to get hold of that paper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be rather valuable,” murmured Duncan,
as if struck by a sudden thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet it would! With that document in his possession,
a fellow could just about make Mike Lynch do
as he pleased. Mike said that he had shouldered all
the blame for the betraying of those signals. If that’s
true, and I could get hold of that document, I’d have
the power to drive him out of college. Say, Ditson,
isn’t there any way we can get our hands on that
paper?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Duncan meditated a moment, puffing softly at his
cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not easy to get anything away from Merriwell,”
he said. “I presume Merriwell will carry that
paper in his pocket. If some fellow could find an
opportunity to go through his pockets——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the gymnasium, say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so easy there, for he has a locker into which
he puts his valuables. Of course, a man might find
an opportunity to break open that locker, but it’s dangerous
trying such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He might be held up on the highway and robbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That gives me an idea,” muttered Dunc, scratching
his head. “Saw my sister this afternoon, and she told
me that Merriwell and Buckhart were going to call
on her this evening. Unless they’re taking the girls
out, those chaps usually walk when they call there.
The Midhursts live pretty well out toward the outskirts
of the city. I suppose a man might be held up
out that way. It would be much easier, though, if one
of those chaps was going out there alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you suppose that we could do it?” asked
Wolfe. “We could wear masks and turn our coats,
and have a couple of pistols, and I’ll bet we could pull
off the job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” murmured Dunc, rubbing his chin.
“It would be better to have two more fellows with
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we don’t want to let anybody else in on this.
Besides, I don’t know whom you’ll get. The most of
our crowd wouldn’t have nerve enough to tackle the
job. They got pretty well upset after that racket with
Tucker, when the old warehouse burned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t try to get any of the old crowd,” said
Dunc. “I think I know one chap we might induce to
take a hand. He’s a tough customer, and I don’t suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>it would be the first holdup he’s ever participated
in. More than that, he has a grudge against Merriwell.
It would be well enough to take him into the
game in case he’ll work for a reasonable sum. I think
he will, as he’s on his uppers at the present time. He’s
a big brute, and he might make some impression on
Buckhart and Merriwell. Unless we can get some one
like that, I hardly think we had better tackle the job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If—if you can—get hold of this—this person,”
faltered Wolfe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll try it,” said Duncan promptly. “Meet me at
Fred’s about eight this evening. I’ll let you know,
what success I’ve had and whether we’ll try this holdup
scheme or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Bern, turning toward the door;
“I’ll be there.”</p>

  <h2 id='LI' class='c005'>CHAPTER LI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE HOLDUP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Dick and Brad, in a jovial mood, were returning
from their evening call. It was about nine-thirty, and
the night was dark, with a raw wind from Long Island
Sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a rather dark old corner,” observed Dick,
as they started to turn into another street. “Wonder
what’s the matter with the street light here? It doesn’t
seem to be attending to its duties this evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone on a strike, perhaps,” observed Brad, with a
chuckle. “This would be a good place to——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold up your hands!” commanded a hoarse voice,
as two masked figures suddenly sprang out before
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>One seemed to be a big man, while the other was a
rather undersized chap. Both held their arms outstretched,
and, despite the darkness, the boys fancied
they caught the gleam of nickel-plated revolvers held
in the hands of the masked men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be quick about it, youse fellers!” growled the one
who had ordered them to put up their hands. “H’ist
your paws if you don’t want to git the tops of yer
heads blew off! Put ’em up, I say!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, put ’em up!” wheezed the little chap, shaking
his pistol. “Don’t try no funny business, fer dere’s two
udder fellers behind ye, see?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great horn spoon!” exploded the Texan. “Partner,
it’s a holdup!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re right here,” announced a voice behind them,
“We’re not going to hurt you unless you make a foolish
move. Better act sensible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of this warning, the Texan made a sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>duck and lunged at the small man who had confronted
him. With a sidelong sweep of his arm, Buckhart
struck the pistol aside. Evidently, this caused the
man’s finger to contract on the trigger, for there was
a sudden spurt of fire and a sharp report.</p>

<p class='c007'>This astonished Brad, who had more than half
fancied the holdup was a practical joke. Realizing that
the masked men were carrying real pistols which were
loaded, the Texan gave a snarl and grappled with the
little fellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, Dick Merriwell had sought to imitate
his chum’s example, but had been clutched from
behind and flung to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were four of the assailants, two of whom
had come upon the unsuspecting boys from the rear.
These two sought to give their attention to Merriwell,
and the trio went flopping and twisting and writhing
into the gutter, striking against the electric-light pole
with such violence that the stick of carbon in the globe
far above their heads was loosened, a contact was
made, and, with a spluttering, hissing sound, the light
came on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The big ruffian who had first commanded the boys
to put up their hands now turned his attention to
Buckhart, who had the smaller rascal pinned fast to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reversing the pistol in his hand, the man lifted it
and struck Brad a stunning blow upon the head. With
a faint, gasping groan, the Texan fell across the little
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on here, Cully!” said the thug who had dealt
the blow, as he kicked Brad one side with his foot, and
attempted to lift his comrade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently, Cully was also knocked out, for he made
no effort to rise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell had seen Buckhart struck down. With a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>shout of fury, he smashed one of his antagonists a
staggering blow, torn free from the other, whirled, and
hurled himself upon the thug with the revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You whelp!” he said, seizing the fellow’s wrist
and giving it a twist which caused him to drop the
weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ditson and Wolfe were the two fellows who had
come upon the waylaid boys from the rear. Like the
thugs whom they had paid to assist them, they were
masked and otherwise disguised. But they carried no
weapons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Duncan had made a bargain with the big man,
Slugger Shea, who had proposed bringing along Cully
as a companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shea had ridiculed the idea that the boys might put
up a fight. It was his belief that he could scare any
two Yale men blue, and relieve them of their valuables
without assistance. Still, he acknowledged that Cully
would come in handy to go through the pockets of the
victims. Besides that, Slugger had a friendly feeling
for Cully, and he wanted his friend to share in the
profits of the job. It was understood, however, that,
under any circumstances, the two ruffians should be
paid five dollars apiece, and they agreed to give up to
their employers whatever papers, letters, or other documents
they might secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunc and Bern had decided that it would be well
enough for them to take a hand in the business, as
they could then make certain of getting possession of
such plunder as they desired. Besides that, they
fancied Merriwell and Buckhart would be doubly
frightened on finding themselves trapped between two
fires. But the boys had upset the calculations of these
rascals by unexpectedly showing resistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good gracious!” gasped Wolfe, in dismay. “Hadn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>we better hit the high places, Dunc? The police—that
shot is liable to——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buckhart is down and out!” hissed Ditson. “Give
a hand here! We’ll have Merriwell down in a jiffy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again he hurled himself on Dick’s back. He did
this just as Merriwell, having secured a Japanese wrestling
hold on Slugger Shea, sent the big ruffian
sprawling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick was nearly upset by Ditson’s weight, but he
managed to keep his feet, squirm around, and get a
hold on Duncan. Wolfe rushed in, seeking to render
such assistance as possible. By this time Merriwell’s
fighting blood was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The more the merrier!” he cried, with a strange,
reckless laugh. “Call up your friends! Get them
into it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In some manner he succeeded in slamming his elbow
against Wolfe’s jaw, and Bern staggered backward,
nearly knocked out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shea was a man with a violent temper, and without
an oversupply of brains. By this time his fury was
thoroughly aroused. Snarling like a madman, he rose
to his feet, drawing from beneath his coat a long,
keen knife, on which the cold white light of the street
lamp glinted and gleamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold him, cuss him!” cried the slugger, rushing
at Dick. “I’ll cut him open!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But, with a cry of horror, Ditson gave Dick a sidelong
thrust, at the same time releasing his hold on
the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell tripped over Buckhart, tried to recover
his balance, and went down heavily on his right shoulder.
Shea followed the boy like a bloodthirsty panther,
and pounced upon him as he struck the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Heaven’s sake, let’s get out of this!” gasped
Bern Wolfe, as he wheeled and took to his heels.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“I think we’d better,” muttered Ditson, imitating
Wolfe’s example.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, having fled a short distance, something caused
Duncan to stop and cast a fearsome glance over his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>What he saw chilled him to the core. With Dick
Merriwell still pinned to the ground, Shea had lifted
that gleaming knife to plunge it into the boy’s breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Murder!” thought Duncan, turning again to run
as if his life depended on it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind him a pistol shot ruptured the night, followed
by a scream of pain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>
  <h2 id='LII' class='c005'>CHAPTER LII.<br /> <span class='large'>ROUTING THE RUFFIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buckhart’s senses had been sent wool-gathering, but
he recovered in time to see the ruffian with the knife
pinning Dick to the ground a short distance away.
Merriwell was fighting for his life, but the injury to
his shoulder had seemed to benumb his entire body
and rob him of his strength. Snarling, spluttering,
swearing, the ruffian lifted the deadly knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within reach of his hand, Buckhart saw the pistol
that Dick had wrenched from the man’s grasp. Quick
as thought, the Texan seized the weapon. The double
click of a hammer was followed an instant later by
a sharp report and a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brad had fired at the uplifted hand of the thug.
The bullet struck and shattered two of the man’s fingers.
The knife dropped harmlessly. Holding up
his injured hand, the slugger sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop—stop right where you are!” commanded
Buckhart, leveling the pistol. “If you don’t, I’ll sure
run a tunnel through you! I’ll ventilate you good and
proper!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Shea turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to kill him,” said the Texan, who was
sitting up, “but I think I’ll try for his legs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Crack! crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p class='c007'>The weapon was emptied, but the fleeing wretch
kept on and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I sure am a rotten bad shot,” observed the
Texan, in disgust. “Reckon that’s because I got a
bump on the head that made me see a few stars and
comets. I say, partner, how are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alive, thanks to you,” answered Dick. “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>chipped into the game at the right moment. I believe
that brute meant to knife me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It certain seemed that he had some such intentions.
Where are the rest of the gents?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve skipped—all but one. One of them should
be here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the little man Cully, who had been knocked
down, had crawled off into the darkness and could not
be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Evidently they’re all gone,” said Dick, rubbing his
right shoulder with his left hand. “I’m afraid that
shoulder is hurt pretty bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’m a whole lot unsteady on my pins,” muttered
the Texan. “That was a joyous old scrimmage,
but it didn’t seem to wake up the neighborhood much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some one is coming now,” said Dick. “I can see
a row of brass buttons dancing this way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s about time!” said Brad, as a policeman
came up panting. “You’re rather late, officer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter here?” demanded the officer.
“What are you doing with that pistol? What do you
mean by firing a pistol? You’re both drunk! I think
I’ll take you in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick gave his chum a whimsical look of disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think of that, Brad?” he said. “He’s
going to take us in. We get held up and nearly murdered,
and after it’s all over a gallant policeman appears
and arrests us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that you’re saying?” snapped the officer.
“What kind of a fairy-story have you invented?
You’re a couple of students, and I’m onto your game.
You fellows are forever making trouble. Give me
that pistol.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” growled Brad, handing over the weapon.
“You’re welcome to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you’d better take this knife, also, officer,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>said Dick, picking up the knife and holding it out to
the policeman. “You may find a little blood on the
handle, and it strikes me that there’s a man’s finger
lying there on the ground. Perhaps you’ll want that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cop bent over and stared in amazement at the
bloody human digit which lay on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So help me, it’s a finger!” he gasped, as if unable
to believe his eyes. “What’s it mean? How—why—when——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As long as you’re determined to arrest us,” said
Dick, “we’ll explain to the sergeant at the station
house. Of course, you won’t believe our fairy-story
about a holdup.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jupiter! I’ll believe anything now!” cried the
policeman. “Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were telling him, several citizens from
the neighboring houses come out and surrounded them.
One, a timid, nervous man, substantiated their statements,
shamefacedly acknowledging that he had
rushed out immediately after the first shot, and had
witnessed the encounter between the lads and their
assailants.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t feel like dipping in,” he said, “so I jest
stood back and looked on. It was the hottest fight
I ever witnessed. By Jove, these young fellers did put
up a fearful scrap! There was four against them,
and I don’t know but more than that. I saw four
myself. I tried to holler ‘murder’ when one of the
masked men got this young feller down and lifted a
knife to stab him. Couldn’t seem to make a sound.
Then I saw the other chap grab up a pistol and shoot.
The fellow with the knife gave a howl and then jumped
to his feet. I could see blood running off his hand
when he held it up in the light. When he took to his
heels, the fellow with the pistol banged away at him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>but he kept on running. I’m ready to swear to every
word of this statement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The policeman now sought to obtain a description
of the holdup men from the boys. Of course, this
description was vague and unsatisfactory, as the masks
of the ruffians had prevented Dick and Brad from
seeing their faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The citizens crowded around the two lads and insisted
on shaking hands with them and congratulating
them over their nerve and success in beating off the
holdup men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t mind, young gentlemen,” said the
policeman, now addressing them with the greatest respect,
“I’d like to have you come to the station and
tell the sergeant all about it. This is my beat, but I
was down at the other end when I heard the shooting.
I came as soon as I could. I think we’ll take this
along as a bit of evidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He displayed the human finger, which he now held
partly wrapped in a handkerchief. The timid citizen
who had witnessed the encounter gave his name and
address, stating that he was willing to tell what he
knew of the affair at any time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened that there was a police reporter at the
station house, and the morning papers contained a
complete account of the attempted holdup, the courage
of the boys being lavishly praised.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, with the Manhattan College baseball game only
one day away, Dick found himself with a very lame
shoulder and an almost useless right arm.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“No use, Kates,” said Dick soberly. “You’ve got
to pitch this game. I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The time for the game with Manhattan to begin had
arrived. Yale Umpty-ten was ready to take the field.
The sturdy, bronzed, healthy-looking visitors were on
their bench and ready for the fray. O’Mora, the first
batter, was swinging two heavy clubs, in order to
make one seem lighter when he stepped up to the
plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick had been vainly trying to work the lameness
out of his shoulder. His comrades of the team had
watched him anxiously, for on him they relied. Unless
Dick could pitch, they could not believe there was
any chance of defeating the visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Dick could not pitch. He realized it, and at
the last moment he told Kates to go in. Blessed Jones,
captain of the team, heard Merriwell’s words, and his
long, doleful face suddenly looked longer and more
doleful than ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Dick,” he said soberly. “If you can’t,
you can’t, and that settles it. Go ahead, Sam, and do
your best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, that’s encouraging!” muttered Kates, with a
touch of bitterness, as he turned to Dick. “What show
have I, Merriwell? There is not a man on the team
who has any confidence in me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick seized Sam’s hand, held it with a firm grip, and
looked straight into his eyes as he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t lost confidence in you, Kates. Do your
level best, old fellow. Do it for my sake—and for
Yale.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“I will!” exclaimed Sam, in a low tone, as he strode
out to the pitcher’s position.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the teams dreaded by the Yale freshmen, the
one they now faced had been regarded as among the
most dangerous. The Manhattan College lads always
played the game for all there was in it, and fought it
out to the last gasp. There were no quitters among
them, and therefore they were always dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the scorers’ books the two teams were recorded

<p class='c007'>Dead silence fell on the assembled spectators as
Kates walked into the box. Sam’s keen ears fancied
this silence was broken by a number of repressed
groans. Involuntarily, he flashed a look of resentment
toward his classmates on the seats. Then he threw a
few to Mike Lynch, just to give his wing a last limbering,
whirling and facing O’Mora as the umpire
called: “Play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s first ball was far too high. O’Mora grinned
and held his bat above his head in a derisive manner
after the ball had passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next one was straight over, and the Manhattan
headliner met it with a sharp, snappy swing. It was
a pretty line drive, which whistled past Kates ere Sam
could thrust out a hand for it. With anxiety in his
heart, the pitcher whirled like a flash, making the relieving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>discovery that Rob Claxton had seized the ball
and clung to it like grim death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Clever work, Clax—clever work!” cried Buckhart
heartily. “That’s the way to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates grinned approvingly, and received the ball
tossed to him by the Virginian. O’Mora had started
for first, but he turned back, shaking his head in a
disgusted manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind,” called Captain Mike Marone, of the
visitors. “That was a case of horseshoe. Get after
him, Bestock! Start us off now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bestock, one of the clever hitters of the visitors,
waited until Kates bent one over, and then nailed it
with terrific force.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a scorching hot grounder, but, with an electrified
sidelong leap, Tommy Tucker forked the sizzling
ball with his bare right hand. Tucker was
whirled round in his tracks with a toplike motion, but
managed to keep his feet, recovered, and sent the ball
across to Lynch.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a bad throw, and Mike was compelled to leap
high into the air to get the ball. He got it, however,
and down upon the sack he dropped, just in time to
secure a put-out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“More horseshoes!” yelled Marone. “Whose hunch
did you rub, old man?” This question was directed at
Lynch, who retorted with a satisfied grin, but made
no answer in words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanley looked dangerous as he squared himself at
the plate, poising his bat over his shoulder. He was
a big fellow, and he wielded a heavy club. He had a
reputation as a hard hitter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kates was afraid of this man, and, in working desperately
to prevent Hanley from hitting, Sam got himself
into a bad hole. One strike and three balls were
called.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“Make ’em be good!” cried Marone. “He can’t put
it over!”</p>

<p class='c007'>After glancing toward the bench, on which sat Merriwell,
Kates steadied himself, and carefully sent over
a swift, straight ball. Hanley let it pass, and the
second strike was called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the talk, Sammy,” chirped Tucker encouragingly.
“Now he’s got to hit. Make him do it. Don’t
let him walk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam wisely decided to depend on his backing, and
quickly whistled over another straight one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanley smashed it far into the field, but, after an
astonishing run, Captain Jones smothered the ball and
held it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you think of that?” asked Mel
Dagett, who was sitting on the bleachers, between Toleman
and Poland. “That’s a good start for us, isn’t it?
We ought to be cheering with the rest of the bunch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was luck—nothing more,” said Poland. “I don’t
wonder Marone is howling ‘horseshoes.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With that kind of backing, Kates may be able to
hold the score down, don’t you think?” questioned
Bern Wolfe, at Toleman’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” answered Bill promptly. “Those Manhattan
fellows are not going to bat the ball right at
somebody every time they hit it. Notice every man
did hit it. Kates never can win this game in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Between us four,” said Poland, in a low tone, “I
don’t believe Merriwell’s shoulder is as lame as he
pretends it is. He’s afraid of Manhattan, that’s what’s
the matter. That was quite a fine and fancy story
about the holdup, but it sounded too fancy for me
to believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but the police say the story is all right,” snickered
Dagett. “Have you forgotten that Officer Jordan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>who arrived on the scene after the holdup men
had escaped, picked up a human finger that had been
shot from one of the ruffians’ hands by the wonderful
cowboy, Bradley Buckhart? Say, I wonder how much
those two fellows paid the cops and the reporters to
get such a yarn into the papers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you don’t take any stock in that holdup
story?” questioned Wolfe quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t,” answered Dagett. “Do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t know,” said Bern. “It doesn’t seem
to me that the yarn can be wholly a fake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?” questioned Poland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should fancy some one would expose the deception.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know whether it’s a fake or not,” said Toleman,
“but I agree with Jim in thinking Merriwell has
a case of cold feet, and is getting out of pitching this
game by pretending his shoulder is lame. It’s an outrage
to shove Kates in there to-day. Manhattan has
Hogan, their very best pitcher, against us. He’s on
the slab now. Watch him. Note what he does to our
boys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our boys! He! he! he!” scoffed Dagett. “Do
you mean Mike Lynch? I suppose you’re dead stuck
on Mike now that he’s become a Merriwellite? Yah!
He makes me sick! What do you think of a fellow
like him posing as the soul of generosity and paying
other fellows’ debts? I don’t blame Ditson for taking
advantage of his attempt to fool people, but I guess
we all know the kind of a fellow Lynch is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way, Wolfe,” questioned Toleman, “where
is Ditson? Is he here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” answered Bern. “I haven’t seen
him to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Wolfe lied. He had seen Duncan, and he believed
he knew what the fellow was doing that very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>hour. Both Ditson and Wolfe felt that they were
hovering over a volcano that might burst forth any
moment. They were frightened, and had agreed that
they must take certain precautions to protect themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hogan now opened up on Tommy Tucker, who was
the first batter for Yale. The visiting pitcher had a
great assortment of shoots and benders which seemed
too much for Tommy to fathom. As a result, Tucker
slashed the air twice, fouled a couple of times, and
then lifted a little pop-fly which Halloran gathered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike Lynch looked grim enough as he strode forth
to the plate. He had been placed second on the batting
order because of his ability as a hitter. Realizing,
however, that he was not a popular man in his own
class, Mike now seemed distressingly self-conscious,
and, as a result, he fell an easy victim to the wiles
of Hogan, who struck him out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brad Buckhart did little better than the two who
had preceded him. He hit the ball, and, for a moment,
it seemed that he had popped out a “Texas
Leaguer.” But the infielders of the visiting team could
cover lots of territory, and cover it in a hurry. Both
Marone and O’Mora went after Brad’s ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll take it!” yelled O’Mora. And he caught it
beautifully while running at full speed, with his face
toward the outfield.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the little crowd of visiting rooters were
cheering this play, Wolfe espied Duncan Ditson, who
was looking over the crowd in search of Bern. Immediately
Wolfe waved his cap at Duncan, who clambered
up over the seats and found room at the side of
his fellow conspirator.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, how did you succeed?” whispered Bern,
under cover of the noise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I succeeded,” answered Duncan grimly. “I had to.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“You raised the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I pawned my sister’s watch and rings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did she let you have them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I took them. Couldn’t wait to ask her in an emergency
like this. Shea had to get out of New Haven.
The police were looking for a man who had lost a
finger, and they were bound to nab Slugger sooner or
later if he remained in town. He knew it as well as
I did. He was willing to go, but he had to have the
money to get away. I put the money in his hands myself,
and he says he’ll be out of the city before midnight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think he can get away? Won’t they nab
him? The cops are on the watch, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If they don’t corner him before dark, I think he’ll
get away. He’s been a hobo, and he knows how to
bum his passage on freight trains. As soon as it’s
dark he’ll stow himself away aboard some freight
bound for New York or Boston. If he’s not caught
to-day, there’s every prospect that he’ll not be caught
at all. I’m not going to worry about it any more.
How’s the game going?”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h2 id='LIV' class='c005'>CHAPTER LIV.<br /> <span class='large'>MANHATTAN IN THE LEAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A most astonishing thing was the manner in which
the team backed up Kates this day, while on the previous
Saturday it had gone to pieces behind him in an
exasperating manner the moment the Highbridge
School boys began to hit him. As inning after inning
progressed, with the infielders making the most astonishing
stops and throws, and the outfielders pulling
down hard-batted flies which seemed good for two
or three bases, Kates got a hold on himself, and gradually
improved in his box work. In the fifth inning
Yale made her first runs, two scores, secured through
a clean hit by Buckhart, a sacrifice by Claxton, a base
on balls handed out to Jones, and Manhattan’s first
error, the fielder dropping Spratt’s hit to right and
losing the ball, while Brad and Blessed tore over the
plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the sixth the visitors retaliated with a vengeance.
Three men hit safely in succession. Then,
for the first time, Yale showed symptoms of going
to pieces, for a couple of errors followed, and the
Manhattanites had tallied three times when the smoke
cleared away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you what would happen!” exclaimed Bill
Toleman. “It’s all off now. Kates is useless from
this time on. Look at him! See him crawling in to
the bench like a yellow dog with its tail between its
legs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Evidently you love Kates,” snickered Dagett.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if I can’t pitch better than he can, I’ll eat
my boots. Has any one seen me asking Merriwell or
Jones or Robinson for a chance to pitch on their great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>team? I fought against them at the outset, and I’ve
taken my medicine. I haven’t squealed. I hate a
squealer. That’s why I’m disgusted with Mike Lynch.
I’m not saying that he isn’t sincere now, but I do say
that he has squealed. After blowing and bleating
around about Merriwell, and making so much talk, he
suddenly threw up the sponge. I swear I didn’t know
he was a quitter, but I know it now. He has disgusted
me more than any chap I know of. I’d like
to see him kicked out of college.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this Wolfe gave Ditson a nudge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are others,” whispered Bern. “Oh, if I could
only get hold of that confession! If I knew how to put
my hands on it! Do you suppose Merriwell carries
it round in his pocket all the time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” muttered Dunc, absent-mindedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ve got an idea that he may keep it somewhere
in his room,” said Wolfe. “I’d like to get into
his room and make a search. I’d dig it out if it was
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better forget it,” said Duncan. “That blamed old
confession got us into a nasty scrape. I’m worried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I thought you said Shea would get out of
town all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m in hopes he will, but you never can tell what
will happen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think he’d squeal if he was nabbed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course he would. That would be the easiest
way for him to get a light sentence. He’d say he
was paid to do the job by a couple of Yale men. He’d
ring us in as sure as fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about the other man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cully? Oh, he’s sneaked already. He’s gone. He
didn’t wait until morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having obtained the lead, Manhattan seemed determined
to hold the home team down. Hogan pitched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>as if everything he held dear depended on the result.
Nevertheless, Yale was warmed up, and the visiting
twirler had his troubles. But the Blue could not push
a runner past third. Fast fielding behind Hogan terminated
the sixth inning, with the score three to two, in
favor of Manhattan College.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now get after that pitcher and pound him to
death!” fiercely urged Marone, as the visitors trotted
in to the bench. “This ought to be our inning. We
ought to pile up some more runs right here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell had talked encouragingly to Kates, and,
to the surprise of every one, Sam opened the seventh
by striking out a man. Even though the next fellow
hit safely, Kates did not seem disturbed, and he forced
the following chap to put up an easy infield fly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, Katesy—all right!” piped Tucker.
“They thought they had you going, eh? Well, they’ve
got another think coming!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next man hit, and the fellow on first made
third by fast running.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll do it right here,” announced Marone, from
the coaching line. “Everybody run on a hit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell smiled at Kates and nodded. Sam toed
the slab without a tremor, and quickly put the batter
in a hole, two strikes and one ball being called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right! that’s all right!” yapped Marone.
“You can hit him just the same! He’s easy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The batter did hit, but it proved to be an easy fly
to right field, and Bouncer Bigelow did his duty nobly
by gathering it in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if that wasn’t crawling out of a small hole!”
exclaimed Bill Toleman. “Kates certainly is lucky
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the boys can’t seem to hit Hogan,” said Wolfe.
“Do you think they have a chance to win, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“Not much of a chance, I imagine,” was the answer.
“Still the score is mighty close.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to leave,” whispered Wolfe, in Ditson’s
ear, “but I hate to quit this game. I want to see it
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you want to leave?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a scheme.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of a scheme?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think I know how I could get a chance to rustle
round in Merriwell’s room. I’d just rush up to the
house, ring the bell, and tell the girl that Merriwell had
sent me after something he’d left in his room. If she
let me upstairs, I’d come pretty near finding that confession
if it’s stowed away there. What do you think
of that plan?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you want to take the chances——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk about that after the chances we took
trying to hold those fellows up. I wouldn’t touch anything
else but the old confession. What could Merriwell
do about it if he did prove I got that? What
value could he put on such a paper? Besides, I’d give
the girl at the house a fictitious name. I’d like to try
the trick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I advise you against it. Better be careful until the
clouds roll by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of this advice, Wolfe grew restless every
minute, and when the seventh inning ended, with the
score three to two, Bern whispered a good-by to Duncan,
told the others he would be back in a short time,
and left the stand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>
  <h2 id='LV' class='c005'>CHAPTER LV.<br /> <span class='large'>A BEAUTIFUL BINGLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the eighth inning Manhattan betrayed dangerous
symptoms, for she made a run and filled the bases,
with two men out. Kates then struck out the last
batter.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the score was now four to two. Jones urged his
men to get after Hogan without delay, and they responded
in a promising manner. In a sharp batting
rally, they drove in a score, but a fancy double play cut
short their chances of tying or taking the lead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manhattan abated none of its fierceness when the
ninth opened. The first batter landed on Kates for a
safe single. Following this, came a fierce drive that
got away from Tucker, and two men were on bases.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later Sam hit a batter on the hip, and the
sacks were filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marone coached jubilantly, announcing his belief
that something like a dozen runs would be chalked
down to Manhattan’s credit in the ninth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the critical point of the game, and Kates got
the rattles at last. Try as he might, he could not find
the plate, and, as a result, he walked the next batter,
forcing in a run.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all off,” announced Bill Toleman, to his companions
in the stand. “He couldn’t find the rubber
now to save his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dagett seized Toleman’s wrist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look!” he said. “What’s that mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jove! Kates is going to the bench!” exclaimed
Ditson. “Who’ll pitch?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“Merriwell,” said Poland. “He’s going into the box
as sure as fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he has a lame shoulder,” snickered Dagett.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s let Kates lose the game,” said Toleman, “and
now he’s going to show off. It’s too late for him to
do anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” nodded Ditson. “The game is over.
Merriwell ought to be batted after sitting on the bench
and letting those fellows have their own way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mike Marone stood, hands on his hips, and laughed
as Dick walked out to pitch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like to limber up a little, Merriwell?” he inquired.
“Give you all the time you want.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks for your generosity,” said Dick. “I don’t
believe I’ll bother to limber up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow! wow! wow!” barked O’Mora. “He don’t
have to limber up! He thinks we’re easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick received the ball, and toed the slab in a position
to pitch with his left hand. He could not use his
right, but he hoped to check the enemy, just the same.
The first ball delivered was so wild that it came near
getting past Buckhart, who stopped it by a marvelous
sidelong leap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow! wow! wow!” came again from O’Mora.
“What do you think of that? Better use your other
hand, Merriwell. You can’t find the pan with your
left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everybody run!” shouted Marone. “Score on the
first passed ball!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There won’t be any,” muttered Buckhart, as he
resumed his position behind the bat and gave Dick a
signal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next ball pitched by Dick came over the plate.
It looked good to the batter, but he simply popped up
an easy fly that was taken by Otis Fitch.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Don’t try to kill the ball!” shouted Marone. “Don’t
try to knock the cover off! You can all hit it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure you can hit it,” said Buckhart, in a low tone;
“but hitting it safe is what counts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dick had fooled the next batter with two
elusive benders, it began to look as if hitting the ball
was not such an easy thing, after all. Forced into a
corner, the batter finally lifted a high foul, which
Buckhart got under and gathered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s two, partner,” laughed the Texan, as he
tossed the ball to Dick. “Why, they couldn’t hit you
safely if you pitched with your feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get in there, now,” urged Marone, as O’Mora
trotted to the plate. “A little single is all we want.
A little safety is the goods. You know where to put
it, Mat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But suddenly Dick bored over a fast one, and
O’Mora literally threw himself off his feet in the effort
to get against it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow! wow! wow!” he yapped, as he picked himself
up. “Where’d you get that speed, Merriwell?
How can you do it with your little left? Be gentle!
be gentle! Give me a chance to look at the ball when
it comes over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Dick. “How’s this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He lobbed up a slow one, and O’Mora nearly broke
his back reaching out to hit the ball before it was anywhere
near the plate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marone snapped at the batter, and O’Mora shook
his head with a comical look of dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t strike out!” he muttered to himself. But
that was precisely what he did do. Dick worked with
all the craft at his command, and finally led O’Mora
into reaching for a nasty curve which he could not
touch.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Yale came to bat in the last of the ninth, with the
score four to two against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got to have two to tie and three to win,”
said Dick cheerfully. “Here’s where we get them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the wrong end of the batting list was up. Jones
was to be followed by Spratt, Bigelow, and Fitch, the
three weakest hitters on the team.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get to first, Blessed,” urged Merriwell. “Get there
somehow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the captain felt that it might not do any
good, he stalked forth and smote the ball a terrific
crack that landed him on the initial sack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hit and run, Spratt—that’s the game,” murmured
Merriwell, as Jack walked out to the pan.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Spratt simply lifted a high infield fly that was
captured by Marone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Looks bad, partner,” whispered Buckhart, in Dick’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell made no reply. Claxton and Tucker were
coaching. Bouncer Bigelow, looking pale and shaking
like a jellyfish, walked out and swung with all his
might at the first ball pitched by Hogan. The ball
struck on the under side of the bat, shot down to the
ground, and twisted off to one side with a queer, toplike
motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without the remotest idea as to what he had done,
Bigelow hurled the bat straight up into the air and
let himself out for first, while Jones went to second.
It was a lucky stab, for the ball, after threatening to
roll foul, stopped inside the base line, and Bouncer
got a safe hit in this manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two to tie and three to win, Fitch,” said Dick, as
the next batter left the bench.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fitch had not touched the ball for the day. Hogan
regarded the fellow as an easy mark. Otis surprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>every one by smashing a hot grounder toward Marone,
who made a startling stop, but juggled the ball and permitted
the bases to fill. It was Merriwell’s turn to
strike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two to tie and three to win, partner,” said Buckhart,
as Dick picked out a bat. “You’ve got to do it
for us! You’ve got to save this game! Give us a
bingle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick forgot his lame shoulder. He forgot everything
except the necessity of getting a clean hit. After
missing one of Hogan’s curves, he found the ball with
a sharp, snapping swing, and lined it far into right
field.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Yale stand rose with a roar as it was seen that
Hanley could not touch that long line drive. The ball
struck the ground and went bounding away, away to
the far extremity of the field, while man after man
romped joyously over the plate. Dick had won the
game by this beautiful bingle.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c007'>When Merriwell entered his room, followed by
Jones and Buckhart, he discovered that everything was
in disorder. The drawers of his desk had been pulled
out and their contents emptied on the floor. This was
likewise the case with his dresser.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello!” he cried. “What’s this mean? Some one
has been here while I was gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later he had reached the private drawer
which he always kept locked. One glance showed him
that it had been pried open and the lock broken. The
contents of this drawer, however, had not been scattered
upon the floor. Everything was there—everything
save one thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The confession of Mike Lynch was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was about the time when Merriwell made this discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>that Duncan Ditson entered his own room and
found Bern Wolfe waiting for him there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello!” exclaimed Dunc, in surprise. “Forgot
about you in the excitement. Say, do you know what
happened? Well, Merriwell went into that game and
won it with a corking hit in the ninth inning. Isn’t
that just his luck?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk to me about luck!” snarled Wolfe. “I’m
sore! I’m disgusted!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? What’s happened? Did you try to get hold
of that confession?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Try?” rasped Bern, producing an envelope and
flinging it on the study table. “I should say I did!
There it is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There it is? Then what’s the matter? What ails
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfe caught up the envelope, and drew forth the
sheets of paper it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What ails me?” he hissed. “Just take a look at
this! Here’s that valuable confession!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spread out the sheets of paper, and Ditson gazed
at them in surprise, for apparently there was not a
line of writing upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confession?” muttered Duncan. “What are you
talking about? There’s nothing there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was once. Look here—look close. Here,
you can see the faintest tracing of a word. There, you
can see part of another word. There was writing on
this paper once. Why, I can even see a bit of my
own signature down in this corner, but it’s gone. It’s
faded. It’s no good to any one now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking intently at the paper, Ditson was able to
make out the faint tracing of a few detached words
upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly Duncan smote his clenched right fist into
his left palm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Well, if that wasn’t a slick trick on the part of
Lynch!” he cried. “He wrote his confession with sympathetic
ink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With what? Sympathetic ink?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. That’s ink that will fade and vanish entirely,
a few days after it is used. I was with him when he
bought it. He told me he had a girl to whom he was
writing letters, and, as he feared she might not destroy
his letters, he was taking care to use the kind of ink
that would prevent those epistles from ever rising like
ghosts to haunt and confuse him. Wolfe, we’re a couple
of blamed fools!”</p>

remarkable adventures in out-of-the-way corners of the globe are really
classics, and every one should read them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack is a splendid, manly character, full of life and strength and
curiosity. He has a number of very interesting companions—Professor
Mole, for instance, who is very funny. He also has some very
strange enemies, who are anything but funny.</p>

<p class='c007'>Get interested in Jack. It will pay you.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after which this great line of books for boys is
named.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Although literature is generally regarded as
more or less of a luxury, there is such a thing
as getting your money’s worth, and a little more,
in the way of literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>For seventy years the firm of STREET &amp;
SMITH has specialized in the publication of
fiction. During all this time everything bearing
our imprint represented good value for the
money.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, about thirty years ago, we began the
publication of a series of paper bound books,
which has since become world famous by the
name of “The S &amp; S Novel,” we did our best
to publish the right sort of fiction. The sales
of these books proved that we have succeeded in
interesting and pleasing the American reading
public.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are over 1,800 different titles in our
catalogue, and every title above reproach from
every standpoint. The STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVEL has been rightly called the fiction of
the masses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not be deceived by books which look like
the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS but which
are made like them only in looks. Insist upon
having paper covered books bearing the imprint
of STREET &amp; SMITH, and so be sure of
securing full value for your money.</p>
